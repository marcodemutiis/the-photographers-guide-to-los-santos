### Director Mode {-}

Director Mode allows players to interact with GTA V as a movie set where one can customize the character appearance, weather conditions, vehicle and pedestrian density, and much more.
It was first introduced in the PC version of the game with the Rockstar Editor, and later added to the console title in 2015.


There are 3 ways to access Director Mode:

1. On the game pause menu go to ```Rockstar Editor``` tab (last tab on the right) and select ```Director Mode``` 
2. press ```M``` key on PC to bring up the ```Interaction Menu``` and select ```Director Mode```
3. Press the ```UP Arrow Key``` to take out the in-game smartphone and dial ```1999578253``` to activate ```Director Mode```. 

Note: Director Mode is unavailable when player is in a vehicle, wanted, or active in a mission.

Once activated, the game will open up the main Director Mode scene showing a casting trailer with a menu from which the player can choose from a number of options. Here the player can change the appearnce of their character by selecting a different model.

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html')}

```

The player can also set the scene, manipulating the conditions of the game world as if it were a movie set: time of day, weather conditions, populations and vehicle density can all be controlled from the Director Mode menu.

### Scene Creator {-}

### Capturing Gameplay {-}

There are two ways of to capture gameplay: ```Manual Recording``` and ```Action Replay```.

MANUAL RECORDING
Hold ```ALT + F1``` for ```Manual Recording```. Gameplay will be recorded in the background until ```LEFT ALT + F1``` is pressed to save the recording or ```LEFT ALT + F3``` to cancel the recording.

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html')}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/scriptingGifs/recording.gif', dpi = NA)
```

ACTION REPLAY
This option records gameplay footage after the fact. Press ```F2``` to buffer recorded data in the background, but note it will not record anything until you press ```ALT + F1``` to save action replay.

Recorded clips will be between 30 and 90s seconds in length, depending on how busy your action is. You will be notified if you are running out of space on your hard drive and you can define the amount of hard drive space you use for the Rockstar Editor by going to the game main menu in ```SETTINGS``` > ```ROCKSTAR EDITOR```.


### Rockstar Editor {-}

On the game pause menu go to ```Rockstar Editor``` tab (last tab on the right) and choose ```Create New Project```. Then select ```Add Clip``` to select the footage you want to use. 

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html')}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/scriptingGifs/rockstareditor_launch.gif', dpi = NA)
```

Recordings will be placed in a timeline: you can scroll through each clip using ```LEFT CTRL + X``` or ```Mouse Click``` and ```Drag``` them. 
Delete a clip using ```DEL```, duplicate a clip with ```LEFT CTRL + C```, or use the ```Mouse Wheel``` to scroll through the timeline.

```Double Click``` on a clip or press ```ENTER``` to begin editing it.

You can change camera angles, effects, speed etc using these. You can scrub through the clip footage using the ```LEFT Arrow Key``` and ```RIGHT Arrow Key``` or the ```Mouse Wheel```. 

The Camera function allows players to position and control the game camera more freely, with less restrictions than the camera options in game play. There is an exception for gameplay footage captured in first-person perspective: here you cannot change camera angle. If there are any other camera restrictions, you'll see a notification on screen. Aside from that, three different camera settings are available in ROckstar Editor:

1. ```Game Camera```  
This is the default third-person camera view filmed from behind the main character.

2. ```Pre-set Camera angles```
These are pres-set camera angles that lock the view at the front, behind, sides or above the main character. You can zoom in an out from these.

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html')}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/scriptingGifs/rockstareditor_presetCameraAngles.gif', dpi = NA)
```

3. ```Free Camera``` 
The Free Camera can be placed within a defined area but freely around your main character.

```{r fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html')}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/scriptingGifs/rockstareditor_freeCamera.gif', dpi = NA)
```

Press ```F5``` to save your project and camera position.

Take a screenshot or export a Snapmatic picture by pressing the ```TAB``` key. This will save your picture in the game gallery and can only be exported out of the game by uploading the image to Rockstar Social Club.

Use the Game Bar to record a video or export your video using the ```Export``` option on the Project Main Menu. Here you can set frame rate and bit rate. The video will appear in the Video Gallery inside the Rockstar Editor main menu. From there you can view it and upload it to either YouTube or the Rockstar Social Club.

"Nella società della sovrastimolazione, c’è un confine tra schermo e realtà?
La carne si oppone al disincarnato tecnologico.
Il gioco diviene un sogno ad occhi aperti, a tratti più lucido del reale, da cui siamo attratti e intrappolati. Come la deformazione della carne in videodrome allo stesso modo la mappa di GTAV ci intrappola in un mondo dai confini limitati che ci permette (o ci fa credere) di poter fare e di poter essere qualsiasi cosa, o quasi.
“IL VIDEOGAME È LA REALTÀ E LA REALTÀ È MENO DEL VIDEOGAME”
In videodrome in maniera fastidiosa, urticante, l’evoluzione tecnologica viene presentata come un tumore e il suicidio come unica via d’uscita.
PER FORTUNA IN GTAV DOPO IL WASTED C’È SEMPRE UN’ALTRA VITA"
