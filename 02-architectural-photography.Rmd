# Architectural Photography

//general intro on architecture in game spaces, the contruction of virtual cities, architecture photography and how it relates to the game environment, the player as a photographer documenting urban spaces...

> “I saw it as the end of architecture... by pushing the concept to its limit and primarily by using the photograph as a point of departure. This is reflected in the idea that the great majority of images are no longer the expression of a subject, or the reality of an object, but almost exclusively the technical fulfilment of all its intrinsic possibilities. It’s the photographic medium that does all the work. People think they’re photographing a scene, but they’re only technical operators of the device’s infinite virtuality. The virtual is the device that wants nothing more than to function, that demands to function.”
> – Jean Baudrillard - _The Singular Objects of Architecture and Philosophy_, 2000


Architecture photography was born with the invention of heliographs, daguerrotypes and large format cameras in the first half of the 19th century. Due to the long exposure times, buildings were the ideal subjects for the early scientific experiments of oseph Nicéphore Niépce, Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre and William Talbot.

While the relationship between architecture and photography has been part of the medium from its birth for technical reasons, this form of image making has evolved to visually explore the connection with material spaces and forms, as well as the relation between human perception and architectural bodies. The photographic image is not simply a document of a structure, but "is, in fact, _part_ of its architecture".^[Lorenzo Rocha, _Photography and Modern Architecture_ ,"Concrete - Photography and Architecture", Scheidegger & Spiess, 2013] Curator Urs Stahel wrote that "pictures [...] offer a discourse that is unlike the physical experience of architecture. They transform volume into surface; distil matter into forms and signs. Photography shapes architecture, enlarging and reducing it, heightening and shortening it, accentuating it, yet largely leaving it to its own devices."^[Urs Stahel, Foreword to "Concrete - Photography and Architecture", Scheidegger & Spiess, 2013] 

The first architectural photographer is considered to be Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey (1804 – 1892), who started to take daguerrotypes of iconic buildings like the Parthenon in Athens and Notre Dame in Paris from 1841. Architectural photography evolved in two distinct approaches, namely Elevation and Perspective. The Elevation Approach focuses on representing a structure as a two-dimensional image, obtaining a viewpoint that is parallel to the building and aimed at showing as many details as possible. The Perspective Approach aims at depicting the structure within the space, focusing on the third dimension and often taken at an angle or from a vantage point from a corner.

Modern architecture started to become an increasingly popular subkect within photography as the urban landscapes began to be reshaped. Around 1900, French photographer Eugène Atget(1857 – 1927) started focusing on the disappearing architecture of "Old Paris". He captured the alleys and buildings of the pre-revolutionary Paris, which were going to be demolished as part of a huge modernization project. 
Many of Atget's photographs were taken at dawn, which - combined with the urban solitude and emptiness he portrayed, created a special sense of space and ambience. Many photographers were greatly influenced by his images, including American photographer Berenice Abbott (1898 – 1991) who bought most of Atget's negative and prints before moving back to New York from Paris.

Back in New York, Abbott was confronted with a similar modernization process, with the old New York which was fast disappearing. “At almost any point on Manhattan Island, – she noticed – the sweep of one's vision can take in the dramatic contrasts of the old and the new and the bold foreshadowing of the future. This dynamic quality should be caught and recorded immediately in a documentary interpretation of New York City. The city is in the making and unless this transition is crystalized now in permanent form, it will be forever lost[...]. The camera alone can catch the swift surfaces of the cities today and speaks a language intelligible to all.”^[Abbott, Berenice, “Changing New York” (project proposal, New-York Historical Society, 1932); excerpted in O'Neal, Hank. Berenice Abbott: American Photographer. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1982): 16–17.]

The modernist project in architecture meant embracing a more minimalist approach and rejecting ornament. A rational use of material was combined with an analytical and funactional approach. Similarly, modernist photography rejected formal images and the painterly qualities of the pictorialist tradition in favour of a sharp focus, crisp lines and repetition. It celebrated the apparatus as a mechanical tool, and called for a "straight photography"^[Sadakichi Hartmann, “A Plea for Straight Photography,” American Amateur Photographer 16 (Mar. 1904), pp. 101–09; reprinted in Beaumont Newhall, ed. Photography: Essays and Images (Museum of Modern Art, New York 1980), p. 186.]. The city played a major role in this relationship between architecture and photography, with radical architecture and modernist photography sharing an ideological connection. Lorenzo Rocha writes of three examples of closely conected pairs of photographers and architects, who shaped architectual photography in the XX century: Armando Salas Portugal for Luis Barragán, Bill Engdahl for Mies van der Rohe, Julius Shulman for Richard Neutra.

They worked on Duo in projects which include photography of industrial buildings and structures and they were often organized in grids. They wrote several books and their works are for public display in the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Tate Gallery, London, Museum of Modern Art, New York, and several other famous museums.

"We are outnumbered by virtual worlds, overwhelmed by virtual architecture. Videogames and digital art have furnished us with a hundred thousand matterless forms--landscapes where no rock or earth has ever been present, cities founded on depthless skins of image and texture, expanses that will never see the light of a true sun.
And yet, somehow there is material here, a new kind of matter. Some of it is borrowed—photographs, texture references, photogrammetry. Other parts are inherent properties of digital worlds— their obsession with surface, the logic of their light, their base particles; pixels, voxels, polygons."^[Gareth Damian Martin, _Represented , Contested, Inverted_, in "Heterotopias 001", 2017]

### Photographing the Game Screen {-}

#### Analogue Game Photography {-}

//Photographs of a TV screen taken with a digital camera often exhibit moiré patterns. Since both the TV screen and the digital camera use a scanning technique to produce or to capture pictures with horizontal scan lines, the conflicting sets of lines cause the moiré patterns. To avoid the effect, the digital camera can be aimed at an angle of 30 degrees to the TV screen.

#### Screenshotting {-}

On windows there are several ways to take a screenshot. To capture your entire screen and automatically save the screenshot, press the ```Windows logo key``` + ```PrtScn key``` (or  ```fn key``` + ```Windows logo key``` + ```PrtScn key```). The screenshot will be saved to ```Pictures > Screenshots folder```.


On windows 10 and 11 you can use the Game bar to take game screenshots and start/stop game screen recordings. Press the ```Windows logo key```  + ```G``` on your keyboard to open Game Bar.

+ Press the camera icon to take a screenshot of the game screen.

+ Press the circle icon to start a clip, then the square icon to stop recording the game screen.

+ Click on "See my captures" to access the image and video files.
