# Architectural Photography


> “[...] a virtual urban life, like playing on the keyboard of the city as if it were a land of screen. I saw it as the end of architecture … by pushing the concept to its limit and primarily by using the photograph as a point of departure. This is reflected in the idea that the great majority of images are no longer the expression of a subject, or the reality of an object, but almost exclusively the technical fulfilment of all its intrinsic possibilities. It’s the photographic medium that does all the work. People think they’re photographing a scene, but they’re only technical operators of the device’s infinite virtuality. The virtual is the device that wants nothing more than to function, that demands to function.”
> – Jean Baudrillard - _The Singular Objects of Architecture and Philosophy_, 2000



Architectural photography was born with the invention of heliographs, daguerreotypes and large format cameras in the first half of the 19th century. Due to the long exposure times, buildings were the ideal subjects for the early scientific experiments of Joseph Nicéphore Niépce, Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre and William Talbot.

While the relationship between architecture and photography has been part of the medium from its birth for technical reasons, this form of image making has evolved to visually explore the connection with material spaces and forms, as well as the relation between human perception and architectural bodies. The photographic image is not simply a document of a structure, but "is, in fact, _part_ of its architecture".^[Lorenzo Rocha, _Photography and Modern Architecture_ ,"Concrete - Photography and Architecture", Scheidegger & Spiess, 2013] Curator Urs Stahel wrote that "pictures [...] offer a discourse that is unlike the physical experience of architecture. They transform volume into surface; distil matter into forms and signs. Photography shapes architecture, enlarging and reducing it, heightening and shortening it, accentuating it, yet largely leaving it to its own devices."^[Urs Stahel, Foreword to "Concrete - Photography and Architecture", Scheidegger & Spiess, 2013] 

The first architectural photographer is considered to be Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey, who started to take daguerreotypes of iconic buildings like the Parthenon in Athens and Notre-Dame in Paris from 1841. Architectural photography evolved in two distinct approaches, namely Elevation and Perspective. The Elevation Approach focuses on representing a structure as a two-dimensional image, obtaining a viewpoint that is parallel to the building and aimed at showing as many details as possible. The Perspective Approach aims at depicting the structure within the space, focusing on the third dimension and often taken at an angle or from a vantage point from a corner.

Modern architecture started to become an increasingly popular subject within photography as the urban landscapes began to be reshaped. Around 1900, French photographer Eugène Atget started focusing on the disappearing architecture of "Old Paris". He captured the alleys and buildings of pre-revolutionary Paris, which were going to be demolished as part of a huge modernization project. 
Many of Atget's photographs were taken at dawn, which - combined with the urban solitude and emptiness he portrayed, created a special sense of space and ambience. Many photographers were greatly influenced by his images, including American photographer Berenice Abbott who bought most of Atget's negatives and prints before moving back to New York from Paris.

Back in New York, Abbott was confronted with a similar modernization process, with the old New York which was fast disappearing. “At almost any point on Manhattan Island, – she noticed – the sweep of one's vision can take in the dramatic contrasts of the old and the new and the bold foreshadowing of the future. This dynamic quality should be caught and recorded immediately in a documentary interpretation of New York City. The city is in the making and unless this transition is crystalized now in permanent form, it will be forever lost [...]. The camera alone can catch the swift surfaces of the cities today and speaks a language intelligible to all.”^[Abbott, Berenice, “Changing New York” (project proposal, New-York Historical Society, 1932); excerpted in O'Neal, Hank. Berenice Abbott: American Photographer. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1982): 16–17.]

The modernist project in architecture meant embracing a more minimalist approach and rejecting ornament. A rational use of material was combined with an analytical and functional approach. Similarly, modernist photography rejected formal images and the painterly qualities of the pictorialist tradition in favour of a sharp focus, crisp lines and repetition. It celebrated the apparatus as a mechanical tool, and called for a "straight photography"^[Sadakichi Hartmann, “A Plea for Straight Photography,” American Amateur Photographer 16 (Mar. 1904), pp. 101–09; reprinted in Beaumont Newhall, ed. Photography: Essays and Images (Museum of Modern Art, New York 1980), p. 186.]. The city played a major role in this relationship between urban spaces and their images, with radical architecture and modernist photography sharing an ideological connection. Architects and photographers started working as closely connected pairs in the second half of the XX century. Armando Salas Portugal for Luis Barragán, Bill Engdahl for Mies van der Rohe, Julius Shulman for Richard Neutra are some examples of this tightly connected relationship between the architecture and the image that shapes the space of the time.^[For more information about these three case studies see Lorenzo Rocha, _Photography and Modern Architecture_ ,"Concrete - Photography and Architecture", Scheidegger & Spiess, 2013.]

The tradition of architectural photography deeply informs in-game photography practices. Games often attempt to include realistic simulations of existing architecture and allow players to navigate their world through the game camera in a way that is directly linked to the camera operations of the analogue photographer who wants to document the city. Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto series has produced game versions of New York (Liberty City), Los Angeles (Los Santos) and Miami (Vice City). Ubisoft's Watch Dogs franchise modelled its worlds around Chicago, San Francisco and London. Actual photographs of architecture and urban spaces lie at the core of how buildings and streets are modelled and simulated in these spaces: the Watchdogs team "made repeated visits to take photos of different neighbourhoods" and Rockstar "distilled 250,000 photographs and countless hours of video into Los Santos, their version of Los Angeles and its hinterland."^[Hoal, Phil. "From Watch Dogs to GTA V, why 'video games are going to reshape our cities'". The Guardian, 10 June 214. https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jun/10/watch-dogs-gtav-video-games-reshape-cities-sim-city-will-wright]
While the games provide reduced approximations of their original counterparts, most of their landmarks are reproduced in great detail and accuracy. These digital copies and playable spaces can also be considered archival doubles for heritage architecture that might get damaged or disappear. When the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris suffered a structural fire beneath the roof in 2019, it left the iconic Gothic architecture with its spire collapsed, its upper walls severely damaged and most of its roof destroyed. Caroline Miousse, a level artist on the game Assassin's Creed Unity, took around two years modelling the cathedral inside and out, spending 80 percent of her time on the Notre Dame. Miousse "spent literally years fussing over the details of the building. She poured over photos to get the architecture just right, and worked with texture artists to make sure that each brick was as it should be."^[Webster, Andrew. "Building a better Paris in Assassin's Creed Unity", The Verge, 17 April 2019 (originally published in on 31 October 2014). https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/31/7132587/assassins-creed-unity-paris] At the time of the fire, many players and fans of the game recalled the 3D model of the cathedral and speculated if the video game could provide help for the reconstruction plans. Ubisoft offered to provide the reconstruction effort with over 5,000 hours' worth of research on the structure, created relying on "pictures — photos, videos — of modern day Notre-Dame."^[Gilbert, Ben. "As France rebuilds Notre-Dame Cathedral, the French studio behind 'Assassin's Creed' is offering up its 'over 5,000 hours' of research on the 800-year-old monument", 18 April, 2019.  https://www.businessinsider.com/notre-dame-fire-assassins-creed-maxime-durand-ubisoft-interview-2019-4?r=US&IR=T]

Yet the game is not just a simulation of the physical space and realism is more of an added visual effect, which is still subordinate to gameplay. The architecture in the game is still part of an environment to be played, and not just seen. In the case of Assassin's Creed Unity, this is especially true, as the game mechanics focus on the character's ability to climb over the roofs and buildings of the city. Gameplay priorities intervene on the game architecture, setting realism aside in favour of features that allow the player to better interact with the space. “We added things like cables and incense across the second level of Notre Dame so players would be able to move around easier when they’re above the ground,” Miousse explained on Ubisoft blog UbiBlog.^[https://blog.siggraph.org/2019/05/how-ubisoft-re-created-notre-dame-for-assassins-creed-unity.html/] Windows that swing open on the upper levels of the cathedral have also been added, along with gilt panels on the balustrades of the tribune and along the nave, which guide the movements of the player. Bruce Shelley writes that realism contributes to a greater effect but is not essential in gameplay: “Realism and historical information are resources or props we use to add interest, story, and character to the problems we are posing for the player. That is not to say that realism and historic fact have no importance, they are just not the highest priority.”^[Shelley, Bruce. “Guidelines for Developing Successful Games”,  Gamasutra, August 15, 2001. quoted in Galloway, Alexander R. _Gaming – Essays on Algorithmic Culture_, University of Minnesota Press, 2006] Speaking to The Verge, art director Mohamed Gambouz noted that the pointy rooftops of Paris in the game had to be smoothed out so as not to interfere with the player’s parkour flow. That was just "one of many changes made to make ACU’s Paris not only work better for a game, but also match the vision of Paris that players have in their mind. Gambouz calls it the “postcard” effect. 'When people talk about Paris they have postcards in their mind,' he says, 'even if this postcard isn’t accurate or truthful to the setting.'" ^[https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/31/7132587/assassins-creed-unity-paris]	There are also technical restrictions that get in the way of realism in game architecture. For example, the tympana above the main doors of Notre Dame's cathedral are full of intricate sculptures, which are not rendered as 3D objects in the game. Instead, the game designers created 2D textures that give the appearance of being sculpted , through "an optimization technique that looks great and doesn’t compromise immersion — unless you get really close and swing the camera around to break the illusion."^[https://www.polygon.com/features/22790314/assassins-creed-unity-notre-dame-restoration-accuracy] Finally, the game architecture might also be affected by copyright laws that protect the original building. "Notre-Dame is [...] owned by the French state, not by the Catholic Church, and it’s a designated historic monument, to boot, one that’s continually being restored. Much of the cathedral is under a patchwork of copyright restrictions."^[ibid.] That meant that all of the sculptures, the paintings, the rose windows of the church could not be authentic to real life and had to be adapted by the designers to circumvent French copyright laws. Miousse spoke of Notre-Dame’s organ: “It’s just so huge and beautiful… and copyrighted. We couldn’t reproduce it exactly, but we could still try to nail the feeling you get when you see it.” ^[https://blog.siggraph.org/2019/05/how-ubisoft-re-created-notre-dame-for-assassins-creed-unity.html/]

Similarly, Grand Theft Auto V's Los Santos is a parodic approximation of 2011 Los Angeles, which "is selectively shrunk for the experience of the gamer. Los Santos represents Los Angeles through fragmentation, simplification and social stereotypes."^[Teo, Mark D. "The Urban Architecture of Los Angeles and Grand Theft Auto", 2015, p.5. https://www.academia.edu/18173221/The_Urban_Architecture_of_Los_Angeles_and_Grand_Theft_Auto] Countless online videos and articles celebrate Los Santos' realism, with a whole genre of "GTA 5 vs Real Life" posts comparing game screenshots with photographs of Los Angeles and its landmarks. The graphical qualities of photorealism of Grand Theft Auto V and the painstaking digital doubling of buildings and structures leave no doubt in each of these posts that Los Santos represents Los Angeles. Its toponymy doubles down on the copy: the Griffith Observatory appears as Galileo Observatory, The Bixby Bridge in Big Sur becomes the Big Creek Bridge, Pershing Square is Legion Square and the iconic Hollywood sign is transformed into the same signage that reads Vinewood instead. Mark D Teo notes that "the Los Santos conceptualisation of modern Los Angeles is omnipresent and mocking; it is an extension of its former city."^[ibid. p.50] Grand Theft Auto V is certainly not the first mediated representation of the city of Los Angeles, which has appeared so often in film and television to create in its visitors a sense of uncanny familiarity. D. J. Waldie writes that “we are all citizens of Los Angeles because we have seen so many movies”^[Waldie, Donald J. "Beautiful and Terrible: Los Angeles and the Image of Suburbia", in _Seeing Los Angeles: A Different Look at a Different City_. Los Angeles: Otis Books. 2007] and critic Keith Stewart has suggested that the movie Drive is essentially “a non-interactive version of Grand Theft Auto.”^[_How Video Games Changed the World_. Directed by Al Camborn, Marcus Daborn, Graham Proud & Dan Tucker (film). London: Channel 4. 2013. 1hr8mins] Will Jennings argues that Los Santos is to be interpreted as a Situationist fragment collage of Los Angelese, "akin to Guy Debord’s Naked City (McDonough, 2002, p.241), using ideas of the dérive and utilising simulated landmarks not only as mediators between simulated space and the real L.A. but also as navigational devices as outlined in Kevin Lynch’s 1960 Image of the City (Tea, 2005)."^[Jennings, Will.

Game architecture is therefore not simply a copy of its physical counterpart and it's not only gameplay, technical limitations and copyright that affect virtual buildings and spaces. Furthermore, the digital technologies at the core of computer graphics and games have completely transformed architecture and photography, as well as the relation between the two. The image in its digital and networked form has come to shape the experience of architecture, to the point of even affecting its creation. Designer Alexandra Lange, talking to the podcast 99% Invisible, says that especially hotel and restaurant interiors are being affected by Instagram. These spaces are being increasingly designed to lure visitors with their Instagrammabilty. Lange recalls: “You know, one architect told me that it’s really important to have an Instagrammable bathroom.”^[https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/instant-gramification/] There is a temporal reversal between the architectural photography of the XIX and XX century that documented the experience of the space and contemporary spaces that are built by the image that they will create and distributed online. The image, in other words, comes first. Similarly, architectural renderings of newly planned neighbourhoods create an image of the future and idealised architecture. They are spaces that do not yet physically exist and where the architectural photograph not only precedes them but create them. Before they are built, these spaces are constructed through CGI and software that are enmeshed in both the architectural process as well as the imaging systems. Joel McKim argues that architectural renders belong to the category of "projective images", as they "attempt to bring an as yet non-existent reality into being."^[McKim, Joel. "Into the universe of rendered architectural images", Unthinking Photography, 2019. https://unthinking.photography/articles/into-the-universe-of-rendered-architectural-images] Such images are becoming ubiquitous and ever more powerful, employed in visualisations of urban speculations and simulation technologies. For McKim these projective images are very much connected to Flusser's idea of the technical image: "while traditional images depict or represent the outside world, technical images envision or inform it. Technical images, in other words, are not mirrors but projectors. And what they project outwards, in very circular fashion are our very own models, concepts and texts – what Flusser calls 'programs'. Technical images, we might say, are not images or representations of the world, they are visions of the world remade to correspond to our own texts, concepts or programs. Architectural renders are, in many ways, quintessential examples of the technical images Flusser had in mind."^[ibid.] For Tobias Revell, these architectural images "overwhelm us into an unquestioned sense that this is the future", through "their aesthetic richness – usually highly saturated, dramatic and glossy – as well as their physical size [...]. Once again, they piggyback the camera’s perceived objectivity but this time into a kind of hyper-real fantasy so convincing that any disbelief is suspended."^[Revell, Tobias. "Rendering the Desert of The Real", Unthinking Photography, 2019. https://unthinking.photography/articles/rendering-the-desert-of-the-real] Similarly, game design has been influenced by the history of architecture while at the same time game environments have affected architects, "blurring the boundaries of what belongs to the physical or the virtual world, with principles from both sides transferring either way."^[Foulston, Marie. "Introduction", _Videogame Atlas: Mapping Interactive Worlds_. Luke Caspar Pearson and Sandra Youkhana. Thames & Hudson. 2022. p.7]

Game space, however, sits between the copy of physical structures and architectural renderings: it is "a space neither separate from real space nor simply a continuation of it."^[Cohen, Julie E. "Cyberspace As/And Space". _Georgetown Law Faculty Publications and Other Works. 807_. 2007. scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/facpub/807] Game worlds are somehow stuck between simulating physical spaces in a way that is as realistic as possible, while shaping new visions of cities and "projecting" an own image of a world. They are made of (and from) photographs, and they generate new images through computational processes and realistic graphics. Gareth Damian Martin notes that "we are outnumbered by virtual worlds, overwhelmed by virtual architecture. Videogames and digital art have furnished us with a hundred thousand matterless forms--landscapes where no rock or earth has ever been present, cities founded on depthless skins of image and texture, expanses that will never see the light of a true sun. And yet, somehow there is material here, a new kind of matter. Some of it is borrowed—photographs, texture references, photogrammetry. Other parts are inherent properties of digital worlds— their obsession with surface, the logic of their light, their base particles; pixels, voxels, polygons."^[Martin, Gareth Damian. "Represented , Contested, Inverted". in _Heterotopias 001_. 2017] On top of that, game spaces are also made to be navigated and experienced. The player who explores the built space inside computer games might turn into a photographer. They stop playing to screenshot virtual architecture, to study the game space in relation to the player. 

In-game photographers might also investigate virtual architecture from the perspective of its materiality – its textures and 3D models – exploring how its structures are "built". In his series _The Edge of The World_ and _Flying and Floating_, Robert Overweg examines the impossible buildings and the incongruous textures that make the architectures of games like Half Life 2 and Left 4 Dead 2. The artist writes: "I try not to follow the roads I am supposed to take, but try to seek out my own path within and outside the given boundaries of the game. I find joy in making use of a glitch/error which gives me the possibility to have a different look at the virtual world. Flying around and running through walls which I am not supposed to do gives me a sense of freedom and the ability to move in ways I can't in the physical world. I want to look behind the curtain of the virtual facade and show it to the world."^[https://www.shotbyrobert.com/glitches] Architectural glitch photography is visually reminiscent of Gordon Matta-Clark's 1970s "anarchitecture" works. These were photographs and films documenting the artist sawing and carving sections of buildings, revealing the infrastructure and hidden materials of architectural structures.

Alternatively, photographers use the game object as a tool itself, a device to create structures and architectural images. In a course on digital and networked photography held at F+F School for Art and Media Design Zurich in 2019 (which among other experiences was an inspiration to The Photographer's Guide to Los Santos), Kaja Fuchs worked with her younger sister to create buildings in the game Minecraft based on the iconic work of German photographer Hilla and Bernd Becher. For forty years, the german duo photographed disappearing industrial structures like water towers, coal bunkers, gas tanks and factories. Their images were always taken in black and white and the photographers approached every building in an almost scientific way, bringing multiple structures together in grids. The Fuchs sisters acted in a similar connection to the modernist architect and photographer pairs of the second half of the XX century, reconstructing the water towers in the 3D game and controlling the camera and the visual effects to reproduce the strict photographic rules originally employed by the Bechers. The game space allowed the players to act as both architect and photographer.

Architecture and photography have been interacting with each other for almost two centuries, affecting each other and taking different roles in many processes of building spaces and imag(in)ing structures. The architectural photograph was born as a representation of the past and from the distance. Throughout the XX century architects and photographers would shape the present by shaping spaces and creating images following the modernist ideology. In its computational and networked form, the image begins to copy physical structures and analogue architectural photography but soon proceeds to shape the creation of space itself. Through its computational simulation, photorealistic graphics and networked circulation, it imagines and projects onto the world. It precedes the built space in the physical world. This virtual architectural image is finally able to be navigated, documented, shaped and played once it becomes part of the game world. Players turned photographers and artists are entangled in this complex journey where images and structures constantly move closer and further apart, where new and old materials merge and structures reject or submit to the laws of physics. In-game photographers document the game architecture but also investigate it, actively explore it and even shape it.

<details>
  <summary>Interview with Gareth Damien Martin</summary>

Matteo Bittanti: What is your background? Can you please summarize your trajectory as a game designer, writer, and artist?

Gareth Damian Martin: I have a very multi-disciplinary background, having originally trained in puppetry and theatre, before moving into graphic and video design, and then studying literature and working in games journalism and design. For the past three years I have been working on a practice-based PhD in experimental literature, specifically focusing on procedurally generated narrative and resolving the supposed conflict between conceptual and expressive forms of writing. Meanwhile I have been working as a games journalist, focusing specifically on the intersection of games with other cultural forms, and more specifically, game spaces and architecture. The Heterotopias project emerged out of this approach, and a need to make a space in which my work on games and architecture might be able to develop freely alongside the work of others. After starting the Heterotopias project I also was offered the change to work at the Bartlett School of Architecture at University College London, lecturing and tutoring on the intersection of urbanism and games. in addition to this, this year I funded my first commercial game, In Other Waters, where the player takes the role of an AI guiding a xenobioloist as they dive an Alien ocean. 

MB: Can you describe the genesis of your project, Heterotopias, and its latest iteration or evolution, The Continuous City?
 
GDM: Heterotopias came from a desire to create a specific space in which I and other writers might be able to explore game spaces and architecture without operating within the limits of mainstream games journalism and criticism. Originally a column on the now defunct site Kill Screen, I expanded it into its own publication in February 2017. In the first year we published three zines, each focusing on long form analysis of game spaces supported by game photography, maps and diagrams. At the same time I have been editing and commissioning a series of online studies which focus tightly on a single game or space. Since the beginning game photography has been a big part of Heterotopias approach and identity, guided by a want to transform the screenshot into a critical tool. The Continuous City, our first book, expands on that idea significantly, consisting of over 200 photographs of urban spaces in games. Structured around a loose typology of urban space, The Continuous City is also unique because of the technique I use to capture the images: a 35mm analogue camera. This technique, which involves projecting the game via a DLP projector and then photographing the image using a black and white, high ISO film stock, is one I developed during the first set of Heterotopias zines, and lends the images it produces a surreal, unreal quality.

MB: In the last few years, game photography underwent a significant transformation: from a fringe activity, it has been endorsed by major hi-tech companies like nVidia, which are actively both facilitating it with powerful tools. This particular Silicon Valley company is not simply recognizing this practice but de facto legitimizing it. In a sense, this shift seems to mirror the evolution of machinima in the late Nineties, which moved from the periphery to the center of gaming culture, when corporations endorsed some machinima makers (Rooster Teeth Productions comes to mind), at least for a while. What's your take on this phenomenon? 
 
GDM: While I am very much in support of the increasing visibility of game photography, and the growing number of accessible tools that are being provided by games as well as hardware manufacturers like nVidia, I think in order to develop the form must step beyond the advertising and publicity focus that this context currently affords it. The support of game photography by major tech companies is a reflection of how useful they see players taking, uploading and sharing screenshots is to their advertising and publicity. The replication of "beautiful" images from high-budget games supports their claims to photo-realism and serves to elevate their position, not that of game photography. However, the tools that come with this commercial support of game photography are introducing the idea to many new practitioners, and I believe many will go on to make work that steps outside of "screenshot" territory.

MB: ...Meanwhile, the number of exhibitions focusing on game photography has increased significantly in the past few years, signalling that the initial resistance by the artworld ("...But is it art?") has been partially overcome. What do you make of the increasing attention by critics, curators, and scholars on the topic of game photography? Where do you see game photography heading?
 
GDM: My use of game photography is very particular, and is more informed by conceptual photographers than it is by other game photographers. But I think precedents set by, for example, the brilliant work of  Harun Farocki's Parallel series have firmly cemented games as a viable subject for video art and photography. If I'm being honest, I don't really see game photography as divergent from photography in general - rephotographing artworks, using the camera as a conceptual or critical tool and photography as an form which is able to create images, not simply take them are all well developed aspects of art photography. Game photography engages with all of these, and doesn't exist within some privileged border.

MB: Let's talk a little bit about terminology and vocabulary  Does it make sense to use the term "photography" for a quintessentially post-photographic practice? Shouldn't it be simply called _screenshooting_?
 
GDM: I think photography is a useful term as it connects the work to a heritage and history of conceptual, still-life and object photography that stretches all the way back to the beginning of the medium. Screenshotting connects the work to a history of commercial interest, product showcases and advertising, and I think only serves to limit how we might think of this work. In my case the term photography is essential - the use of an analogue camera is a core part of the image making process. 

MB: By combining a traditional, pre-digital technique like 35mm cameras and video games you are simultaneously resuscitating a "dead medium" (Bruce Sterling) and remediating photography, that is, incorporating a medium into another (Bolter & Grusin). You're also updating an evergreen photographic genre - street photography - into virtual environments. How does the genre of analogue game photography fit into the ever expanding medium of game photography tout court? 
 
GDM: As I've mentioned I don't personally frame my work within game photography, and am more interested in the reference points of art photographers like Hiroshi Sugimoto and his photographs of wax works and dioramas, Thomas Demand and his images of cardboard models that replicate press photography, and even Man Ray's famous photograph (Dust Breeding) of Duchamp's Large Glass. In this context I don't see analogue photography as a "dead medium" at all - Sugimoto uses large format cameras and roll film for example. In my influences from street photography too, most notably the work of Daido Moriyama and the incredible pinhole camera pieces of Takashi Homma from his book The Narcissistic City, analogue processes are part of an art practice which is very much contemporary. In terms of incorporating one medium into another, I would see it as incorporating games into photography as a subject, but again not as a privileged, unique subject, but instead one closely associated with the history of rephotography, and photography engagement with illusion and the virtual. To me games and photography share a particular quality - they are both images of spaces, rather than spaces in their own right, and so the way they process, and relate to spaces and architecture through virtuality and illusion seems to me to be a strong point of connection. 

MB: A remarkable number of game photographers strive for hyper-realism, trying to blur the already porous borders between realistic depictions of reality through photographic means and their video game counterparts, and, by doing so, they are merging representation with simulation (one example is Duncan Harris). At the same, since technical images are by definition third level abstractions (Flusser), one wonders how (or even if) digital photographs and game screenshots are substantially different: they are, after all, pure code, that is, software (Manovich). What's your take? I'm asking because you write that The Continuous City is "a travelogue of the digital made real", which seems to imply that, by simulating photographic representations, you're attributing ontological consistency to fluid, transient, immaterial practices such as gameplay. Conceptually, this reminds me of a project by Benoit Paillé, Crossroads of Realities, although aesthetically, you have chose a very different style... Am I completely off?
 
GDM: I think what is key here here is that I am not in fact simulating photography as Benoit Paille does, but photographing the game as an object with an actual "true" photographic process. While I ultimately scan my negatives into my computer in order to print them and insert them into the book, each part of the process up to this point is a photographic process like any other analogue photographic process. For me this a key part of the "expansion" or "transformation" of the game I am staging. When I say "a travelogue of the digital made real", I am pointing to the contradictory way in which these images, by abstracting the original subject, grant it a strange veracity - just as a statue beside a static human, when photographed, gains the same limited life as the human within the resulting image. The "reality" of the analogue process grants the unreal spaces of the game a kind of passing connection to the real, and the two become inseparable - the real image and the unreal space. This is especially effective for those who do not recognise or have no experience of the original game space - their first response is often to approach the image as if it is an image of a real space, and then to slowly try to resolve this with the increasingly obvious falsity of the space that becomes more and more evident over time. Even those who have experienced the original game space lose their footing in reality sometimes, and I have had comments pointing out that my images "look just like" the spaces from the game - the viewer unable to resolve their own memories of the same space with the strange image in front of them, therefore separating them to two different planes of reality. 

MB: ...Black and white is a marker of photographic artistry: by deliberately renouncing the vibrant colors of simulated worlds, you're explicitly invoking a photographic tradition with overt artistic ambitions. My question - which has no polemical intent - is this: why looking at the past to capture the essence, the spirit of a (relatively) new medium such as the videogame?
 
GDM: To me the connection to the history of conceptual and object photography is the one I wish to evoke, I have no desire to evoke a nebulous "future" that might be suggested by the technological superiority of games. I would also maintain that black and white is no longer able to be considered a historical practice, as many photographers continue to use black and white photography in contemporary work, especially as it has the effective ability to distance the resulting images from their original referent. I also think one of the least helpful myths around games is that they are contingent on a linear technological progression - that more powerful computer produce better images, and that the aim of games aesthetic  is to reach a point of impossibly accurate image quality. This same myth is one shared by photography - that the "best" cameras are those which produce images at the highest fidelity. By photographing games using a camera built in the 1960s, using a film stock whose process has remained unchanged for decades, I am seeking to destabilise this logic - reality is subjectively judged by the viewer based on learnt and replicated signifiers not on an objective standard of photorealism. It might be more accurate to say I am aiming to distort or shift the spirit of games (if there is such a thing) rather than capture it. 

MB: The Continuous City combines flaneur-like obsessions with photographic compulsion - as Susan Sontag wrote in the 1970s, taking photographs is a way to collect the world, to own it, and to miniaturize it. Do you believe that game photographers obsessively document their journeys in exotic lands in order to claim the spaces they visit? Is game photography just another post-colonial practice? Or should it be considered as a decontextualizing activity, that actively reframes the image, and thus its meaning and effect?
 
GDM: I think both of these concepts - the image as ownership of digital space / the image as reframing of digital space - are actively true. Certainly my project is a kind of obsessive documentation, a pursuit of some quality that I feel is impossible to describe in any other way. However I think the multiplicity of game spaces makes it difficult to see game photography as a process of colonising virtual spaces - these are, after all, spaces designed to entrap, manipulate and engage the player. For that reason I think game photgoraphy leans more towards reframing, and even rebelling against the systems of engagement in games. What I find fascinating in games is the way in which they are starting to show resistance to their own structures internally - photo-modes and features like the "Discovery Tour" tourist-mode of Assassin's Creed Origins point towards a future of games where spaces are hollowed out within compulsive systems to actively subvert or undermine them. I see game photography as engaging with these processes. 

MB: Stephan Mallarmé famously wrote that "Everything in the world exists in order to end up as a book". It appears that this wish applies to the virtual world as well: is the book, as a medium, a legitimizing strategy? Why did you choose static images to document virtual worlds instead of pursuing different multimedia formats, such as video essays or playthroughs?
 
GDM: My intention is not pure documentation, and such a project would find itself crowded out by the huge volume of documentation of game spaces that already exists. To me the images are the work, they don't stand-in for the spaces they depict. This book is a work within the long tradition of artists photo books, and frames itself as such. I'm in no way adverse to video or multimedia projects, in fact I have many in mind for the future of the Heterotopias project, but this project in particular is exploring the relationship of game spaces to photography in particular, and its form follows that intention. 

MB: The literary tradition is explicitly evoked in the very title of your book, which alludes to Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities. Both projects are linked by the wish to catalogue and archive the imaginary, the fantastic, and the exotic. Is your ultimate goal to produce a 1:1 map of the digital ludic?  
 
Gareth Damian Martin: Not at all, in fact I think Invisible Cities suggests the opposite - it is a document that points to maps and descriptions as expressive not objective tools. Calvino isn't cataloguing all the imaginary cities of the world, he is instead describing one city, Venice, from a multitude of perspectives, ones that include what Venice is, what it was and what it might be. He combines all the fantasies and dreams, all the nightmares, with the ideologies, arguments and characters of the city in order to try to describe something real through fiction. This too is my intention - after all the book is called The Continuous City - it points to a singular urban body, united in its disunity. It is a book of fictions too, but ones that equally point to some real place we might once have visited.

## Tutorial {-}

### Playing as a Photographer {-}

Playing as a photographer means ignoring, circumventing and sometimes resist what the game wants us to do and follow our photographic project instead. For starters, we are going to skip the compulsory game introduction, avoid the missions and neglect the narrative plot of the game.
We are going to install a file which allows us to travel to Los Santos with no restriction of any kind, so that we can focus on photographic activities.

To do this we use a completed [game save file](https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/100-save-game). Download the file and extract its content, then copy both files ```SGTAXXXXX``` and ```SGTAXXXXX.bak``` in ```Documents/GTA V/Profiles/YYYYYYYY/```. Once the files are there, you will be able to load the game state by running GTA V and navigating on the pause menu to ```GAME``` > ```Load Game``` and select the 100% game file.

```{r fig.align='left', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html'), fig.link=''}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/loadSaveGame.png', dpi = NA)
```

With the game save file loaded the player is free from the constraint of the main game missions and locked map areas, but the game will still at times resist the photographic project in different ways. The player can be attacked and killed by mountain lions, or beaten up and sent to the hospital by non playable characters. They can drown, fall to their death and get run over by cars.


### Photographing the Game Screen {-}

#### Analogue Game Photography {-}

//To do: technical setup and moiré effect, artists using cameras rather than screenshotting, idea of separating the photographic act "of" the screen rather than the screen copy of the screenshot...
//Photographs of a TV screen taken with a digital camera often exhibit moiré patterns. Since both the TV screen and the digital camera use a scanning technique to produce or to capture pictures with horizontal scan lines, the conflicting sets of lines cause the moiré patterns. To avoid the effect, the digital camera can be aimed at an angle of 30 degrees to the TV screen.

#### Screenshotting {-}

On windows there are several ways to take a screenshot. To capture your entire screen and automatically save the screenshot, press the ```Windows logo key``` + ```PrtScn key``` (or  ```fn key``` + ```Windows logo key``` + ```PrtScn key```). The screenshot will be saved to ```Pictures > Screenshots folder```.

//Steam

On windows 10 and 11 you can use the Game bar to take game screenshots and start/stop game screen recordings. Press the ```Windows logo key```  + ```G``` on your keyboard to open Game Bar.

+ Press the camera icon to take a screenshot of the game screen.

+ Press the circle icon to start a clip, then the square icon to stop recording the game screen.

+ Click on "See my captures" to access the image and video files.

## Content Replication Assignment {-}
Drive around Los Santos or go to the location on the map and take pictures of the architecture of the city through photographs or screenshotting. You are free to try to recreate the images of Gareth Damien Martin or explore different areas and approaches related to architectural photography, virtual urban spaces, digital structures and other topics related to the explored themes.

Mascha Negri, from _Luftige Enge_, F+F, March 2023.


In _Luftige Enge_ Mascha Negri focuses on the industrial areas of Los Santos. Wandering through the buildings in the game, the photographer looked for angles and perspectives that are reminiscent of the work of Germaine Krull as well as Bernd and Hilla Becher. Upon closer inspection, the images show the pixels of the screen, the polygons that make the 3D architecture and the textures of virtual pipes and chimneys. Negri worked with the smartphone camera to photograph the game screen, highlighting the properties of the simulation, while simulataneously following the trajectory of black and white architectural images from the analogue photography tradition. Negri employed digital editing through the smartphone photo app, using high-contrast black and white post-processing to underline the geomatric shapes of the building. The title _Luftige Enge_, literally "airy narrow", follows the contrast between the airy appearance of the smoke coming from the pipes and the massive size and dense positioning of the buildings. Finally, the contrast between analogue tradition and digital images, and between air and mass, can be extended to the relation the between post-industrial society and economy of the game industry and the vanishing heavy industry in the west simulated in the game buildings.
