The Photographer’s Guide to Los Santos is an ongoing project that builds on top of a research on artistic practices within spaces of computer games, with a particular focus on in-game photography, machinima and digital visual arts. It follows some themes and ideas previously explored in the exhibition How to Win at Photography, while focusing more specifically on the relationship between computer games and photographic activities inside the world of Grand Theft Auto V. The idea of a guide refers to in-game photography as a form of ‘virtual tourism’ (Book, 2003), which was also the premise of an actual tourist guide published by Rough Guides in their 2019 Rough Guide to XBOX. Yet this guide project also understands the game world as a site for image production and artistic creation, turning the game into a destination for a ‘game art tourist’. The Photographer’s Guide to Los Santos presents the game environment of Grand Theft Auto V both as a space to explore and in which to create images, as well as a place to navigate and learn about some of the most important artworks that it has enabled to create. The project also brings together several experiences from teaching in-game photography as an artistic practice in different educational settings and institutions, compiling materials and tools for students and artists interested in engaging with the field. The tourist guide of the game world doubles as a photography manual for the in-game photography age, featuring tutorials ranging from game screenshotting to computer programming for creative modding. Through the practical exercises, the project invites to rethink the game object as a space for creative, subversive and critical endeavours, which can be played differently, documented, reclaimed or modified through an artistic approach. Finally, the project draws inspiration from the works of artists who have explored the ‘metaplay’ of photographing game words instead of following the game rules and attempt to reach the goal of winning. The Photographer’s Guide to Los Santos is indebted to all the artists it features, but was particularly inspired by Gareth Damian Martin’s live streamed workshop Photography Tour of No Man’s Sky (realized for Now Play This Festival 2020), Total Refusal &amp; Ismaël Joffroy Chandoutis’s 2021 in-game lecture performance and guided tour Everyday Daylight (realized for the CCS Paris), and Alan Butler’s epic 2020 live endurance performance Witness to a Changing West (realized for Screen Walks) and his ‘Content Replication Assignments’. Grand Theft Auto V Studies Los Santos is the Grand Theft Auto V’s fictional, parodic version of real-life Los Angeles. Just like Los Angeles is the global centre of film and commercial media production, Los Santos is the epicentre of in-game photography and machinima creation. While it may seem reductive to only focus on a single game to address the larger phenomenon of in-game photography, GTA V is the biggest source of creative outputs to date, with its extended open world and one of the largest community of active modders. Launched in 2013, the game contains a world map of more than 80 square kilometers of total area, which includes the urban area of the city of Los Santos and the rural area of Blaine County. This incredibly vast environment features a large desert region, dense forest, several mountains, beachside towns, on top of the large metropolis of Los Santos. The game simulates the everyday life of hundreds of individual NPCs (while it allegedly counts a population of over 4 million) as well as counting 28 animal species, and more than 800 buildings in GTA V are based on real-life landmarks. The size of the photorealistic simulation is only matched by the complexity of the game engine and its code, which - thanks to the effort of GTA V’s modding community - allows players to use the game world as a powerful tool to create new scenes, take controls of its algorithmic entities, modify cameras and reshaping the game into a movie set or a photo studio. Grand Theft Auto V Tourism The project can be seen as something between a playful travel guide of Los Santos and one of the star maps offered to tourist in Hollywood, pointing to the homes of movie actors and hollywood celebrities. This guide allows players to explore the game environment following some of the most interesting artworks that have been created with(in) it. It’s divided in thematic chapters that follow different artistic practices, taking place in different locations of the game environment, followed by different tutorials and exercises connected with the works and the space analyzed. The themes explore different approaches and practices connected to established artistic and photographic currents, with a general introduction text that gives an overview of the ideas, contexts and issues connected to the specific topic. A selection of artworks for each themes is presented by a curatorial statement, introducing the work and its artistic relevance. The work is accompanied by information on the in-game location in which it was produced, inviting the readers to reach the destination in Grand Theft Auto V through maps and indications. The game environment thus becomes the space for possible ‘art tours’, getting insights into the artworks made in GTA V. This form of game tourism allows the player to see the behind the scenes, and experience the making of the works in its place of origin. While the complex algorithms of GTA V produce unexpected interactions and scenes, Los Santos is also stuck in the same time forever. Gas stations, shops, palm trees remain in the same state and location forever, allowing the tourist to witness the exact scene that was first encountered by the artists. Grand Theft Auto V Art Education This project is also an attempt to introduce a video game as a space for artistic intervention, and an invitation to use its mechanics, its code and its environment as a creative tool itself. The game can be played, documented and captured through a form of artistic play, that differs from normative gameplay and does not focus on advancinf and winning but rather engages with the game object critically. Furthermore, the game software can also be manipulated, modified and used as an apparatus to create new images and interactions. The goal of this guide is to combine a curatorial approach that leads the viewer to discover the artworks made in GTA V with a hands on approach that teaches the player the tools for possible artistic interventions in this space. Games are often seen as producing specific cultures and shaping identities through through forms of play that follow the intentions of the developer. Here we understand games as objects to be reclaimed and tools to be deconstructed and rebuilt, both conceptually and literally. Consequently, players are not just passive actors that push buttons in the sequence that they are taught by the machine and its softwares, but open up the black box of the game and become critical thinkers and makers that actively play with the game, or even against it. The Photographer’s Guide to Los Santos can be employed as a resource to accompany workshops for students and artists approaching computer games and interested in learning how to engage with it. Each thematic chapter features a tutorial section that introduces different techniques and strategies to capture images within Grand Theft Auto V, connected to the examples and locations of each section. The chapters are thought to be experienced in order, as the tutorials at times rely on knowledge that is built on top of previous lessons. Each tutorial is accompanied by content replication assignments, in which the readers is invited to use the skills learnd from each chapter to recreate a work presented in that section. Tutorials are intended for anyone who might be playing GTA V for the first time in their life and do not assume any previous experience, although some basic idea of programming is helpful when dealing with scripting and modding the game.

This is reflected in the idea that the great majority of images are no longer the expression of a subject, or the reality of an object, but almost exclusively the technical fulfilment of all its intrinsic possibilities. It’s the photographic medium that does all the work. People think they’re photographing a scene, but they’re only technical operators of the device’s infinite virtuality. The virtual is the device that wants nothing more than to function, that demands to function.” – Jean Baudrillard - The Singular Objects of Architecture and Philosophy, 2000 Architecture photography was born with the invention of heliographs, daguerrotypes and large format cameras in the first half of the 19th century. Due to the long exposure times, buildings were the ideal subjects for the early scientific experiments of oseph Nicéphore Niépce, Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre and William Talbot. View from the Window at Le Gras by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce, 1826-27 Paris’ Boulevard du Temple by Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre, 1839 While the relationship between architecture and photography has been part of the medium from its birth for technical reasons, this form of image making has evolved to visually explore the connection with material spaces and forms, as well as the relation between human perception and architectural bodies. The photographic image is not simply a document of a structure, but “is, in fact, part of its architecture”.1 Curator Urs Stahel wrote that “pictures […] offer a discourse that is unlike the physical experience of architecture. They transform volume into surface; distil matter into forms and signs. Photography shapes architecture, enlarging and reducing it, heightening and shortening it, accentuating it, yet largely leaving it to its own devices.”2 The first architectural photographer is considered to be Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey (1804 – 1892), who started to take daguerrotypes of iconic buildings like the Parthenon in Athens and Notre Dame in Paris from 1841. Architectural photography evolved in two distinct approaches, namely Elevation and Perspective. The Elevation Approach focuses on representing a structure as a two-dimensional image, obtaining a viewpoint that is parallel to the building and aimed at showing as many details as possible. The Perspective Approach aims at depicting the structure within the space, focusing on the third dimension and often taken at an angle or from a vantage point from a corner.

Videogames and digital art have furnished us with a hundred thousand matterless forms–landscapes where no rock or earth has ever been present, cities founded on depthless skins of image and texture, expanses that will never see the light of a true sun. And yet, somehow there is material here, a new kind of matter. Some of it is borrowed—photographs, texture references, photogrammetry. Other parts are inherent properties of digital worlds— their obsession with surface, the logic of their light, their base particles; pixels, voxels, polygons.”3 The Continuous City, by Gareth Damian Martin Gareth Damian Martin, Outskirts, from The Continuous City, Gareth Damian Martin, Pathways, from The Continuous City, artwork text More about The Continuous City Interview with Gareth Damian Martin Getting there + The intersection of Interstate 4 and Interstate 5 manifests the architecture of traffic of the megalopolis.

Since both the TV screen and the digital camera use a scanning technique to produce or to capture pictures with horizontal scan lines, the conflicting sets of lines cause the moiré patterns. To avoid the effect, the digital camera can be aimed at an angle of 30 degrees to the TV screen. Screenshotting On windows there are several ways to take a screenshot. To capture your entire screen and automatically save the screenshot, press the Windows logo key + PrtScn key. The screenshot will be saved to the Pictures &gt; Screenshots folder. On windows 10 and 11 you can use the Game bar to take game screenshots and start/stop game screen recordings. Press the Windows logo key + G on your keyboard to open Game Bar. Press the camera icon to take a screenshot of the game screen. Press the circle icon to start a clip, then the square icon to stop recording the game screen.

GTA V is 100+ GB so it will take a few hours depending on your internet connections) Download Script Hook V, go to the bin folder and copy dinput8.dll and ScriptHookV.dll files into your GTA V directory C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Grand Theft Auto V Download Script Hook V dot net, copy the ScriptHookVDotNet.asi file, ScriptHookVDotNet2.dll and ScriptHookVDotNet3.dll files into your GTA V directory C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Grand Theft Auto V Create a new folder in GTA V directory and call it “scripts”. Download and install Visual Studio Community (free version of VS). Open Visual Studio and check the .NET desktop development package and install it Run GTA V and test if Script Hook V is working by pressing F4. This should toggle the console view. Try to type Help() and press ``ÈNTER``` to get a list of available commands. Creating a Mod File Open Visual Studio Select File &gt; New &gt; Project Select Visual C# and Class Library (.NET Framework) Give a custom file name (e.g. moddingTutorial) Rename public class Class1 as “moddingTutorial” in the right panel Solution Explorer In the same panel go to References and click add References… &gt; Browse &gt; browse to Downloads Select ScriptHookedVDotNet &gt; ScriptHookVDotNet2.dll and ScriptHookVDotNet3.dll and add them Also add System.Windows.forms Also add System.Drawing In your code file add the following lines on top: using GTA; using GTA.Math; using System.Windows.Forms; using System.Drawing; using GTA.Native; Modify class moddingTutorial to the following: namespace moddingTutorial { public class moddingTutorial : Script { public moddingTutorial() { this.Tick += onTick; this.KeyUp += onKeyUp; this.KeyDown += onKeyDown; } private void onTick(object sender, EventArgs e) { } private void onKeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { } private void onKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { if (e.KeyCode == Keys.H) { Game.Player.ChangeModel(PedHash.Cat); } } } } Save file Go to Documents &gt; Visual Studio &gt; Project &gt; moddingTutorial &gt; moddingTutorial &gt; moddingTutorial.cs Copy the .cs file in the GTA V directory inside the scripts folder Open GTA V, run the game in Story Mode (mods are only allowed in single player mode, not in GTA Online) and press ‘H’ to see if the game turns your avatar into a cat Note: every time you make changes to your .cs file in the scripts folder you can hit F4 to open the console, type Reload() in the console for the program to reload the script and test again the changes. onTick, onKeyUp and onKeyDown The main events of Script Hook V Dot Net are onTick, onKeyUp and onKeyDown. Script Hook V Dot Net will invoke your functions whenever an event is called. The code within the onTick brackets is executed every interval milliseconds (which is by default 0), meaning that the event will be executed at every frame, for as long as the game is running. private void onTick(object sender, EventArgs e) { //code here will be executed every frame (or per usef defined interval) } If your function is written inside onKeyDown (withiin the curly brackets following onKeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e){}), your code will be executed every time a key is pressed. If your function is written inside onKeyUp, your code will be executed every time a key is released. private void onKeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { //code here will be executed whenever a key is released } private void onKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { //code here will be executed whenever a key is pressed } We can specify which code is executed based on what keys are pressed/released private void onKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { if (e.KeyCode == Keys.H) { //code here will be executed whenever the key &#39;H&#39; is pressed } } Change Player Model The player character is controlled as Game.Player. Game.Player can perform different functions, including changing the avatar model, and performing tasks. Change the 3D model of your character by using the ChangeModel function. The function needs a model ID, in order to load the model file of our game character. You can browse through this list of models to find the one you want to try (note: not all models seem to load properly): https://wiki.gtanet.work/index.php/Peds These models are all PedHashes, basically ID numbers within the PedHash group. Copy the name of the model below the image and add it to PedHash. For example if you choose the model Poodle, you’ll need to write PedHash.Poodle. To change the model of your player character into a poodle you can write the following function: Game.Player.ChangeModel(PedHash.Poodle); add it in your .cs file in the onKeyDown event, triggered by the pressing of the ‘h’ key: Example code using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using System.Threading.Tasks; using GTA; using GTA.Math; using System.Windows.Forms; using System.Drawing; using GTA.Native; namespace moddingTutorial { public class moddingTutorial : Script { public moddingTutorial() { this.Tick += onTick; this.KeyUp += onKeyUp; this.KeyDown += onKeyDown; } private void onTick(object sender, EventArgs e) //this function gets executed continuously { } private void onKeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)//everything inside here is executed only when we release a key { } private void onKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) //everything inside here is executed only when we press a key { //when pressing &#39;H&#39; if(e.KeyCode == Keys.H) { //change player char into a different model Game.Player.ChangeModel(PedHash.Poodle); } } } } Try to select different models and assign them to different keys to change the model of your character. Use keys that are not already implemented in the game controls to avoid clashes with built in operations. Tasks Our character can be controlled by our script, and given actions that override manual control of the player. These actions are called Tasks and in order to assign tasks to our characters we have to define our Game.Player as Game.Player.Character. The Game.Player.Character code gets the specific model the player is controlling. Now we can give tasks to the character by adding the Task function: Game.Player.Character.Task. Finally we can specify what task to give the character by choosing a task from TaskInvoker list of possible actions. Jump: Game.Player.Character.Task.Jump(); Wander around: Game.Player.Character.Task.WanderAround(); Hands up for 3000 milliseconds: Game.Player.Character.Task.HandsUp(3000); Turn towards the camera: Game.Player.Character.Task.TurnTo(GameplayCamera.Position); Some of the tasks are temporary and accept a time parameter (in milliseconds). Others are persistent, meaning they will keep being executed until the task is actively stopped. To stop a task you can use the ClearAllImmediately(); command: Game.Player.Task.ClearAllImmediately(); Task Sequences You can create sequence of multiple tasks by using TaskSequence and the PerformSequence function. Create a new TaskSequence with a custom name, add tasks to it with AddTask, close the sequence with Close and then call Task.PerformSequence to perform the sequence. TaskSequence mySeq = new TaskSequence(); mySeq.AddTask.Jump(); mySeq.AddTask.HandsUp(3000); mySeq.Close(); Game.Player.Character.Task.PerformSequence(mySeq); Random We can add randomness by using a randomly generated number, which makes things outside of thepredefined programme controlled by us and introduces more autonomous behaviours. We use the Randomfunction to create a randomly generated number between our minimum and maximum parameter (if only one parameter is inserted, the minimum is 0). Random rnd = new Random(); int month = rnd.Next(1, 13); // creates a number between 1 and 12 int dice = rnd.Next(1, 7); // creates a number between 1 and 6 int card = rnd.Next(52); // creates a number between 0 and 51 Let’s create a number to generate a random duration between 1 and 6 seconds, for the HandsUp task. Random rnd = new Random(); int waitingTime = rnd.Next(1, 7); Game.Player.Character.Task.HandsUp(waitingTime * 1000); Subtitles and Notifications Generate subtitles with a custom text string and duration (in milliseconds): UI.ShowSubtitle(&quot;Hello World&quot;, 3000); Generate a notification with a custom text string: UI.Notify(&quot;Hello World&quot;); Content Replication Assignment Deercam reenactment Write a mod script to change your game character into a deer by pressing a key, and make it autonomously wander around Los Santos by pressing another key.
