The Photographer’s Guide to Los Santos is an ongoing project that builds on top of a research on artistic practices within spaces of computer games, with a particular focus on in-game photography, machinima and digital visual arts. It follows some themes and ideas previously explored in the exhibition How to Win at Photography, while focusing more specifically on the relationship between computer games and photographic activities inside the world of Grand Theft Auto V. The idea of a guide refers to in-game photography as a form of ‘virtual tourism’ (Book, 2003), which was also the premise of an actual tourist guide published by Rough Guides in their 2019 Rough Guide to XBOX. Yet this guide project also understands the game world as a site for image production and artistic creation, turning the game into a destination for a ‘game art tourist’. The Photographer’s Guide to Los Santos presents the game environment of Grand Theft Auto V both as a space to explore and in which to create images, as well as a place to navigate and learn about some of the most important artworks that it has enabled to create. The project also brings together several experiences from teaching in-game photography as an artistic practice in different educational settings and institutions, compiling materials and tools for students and artists interested in engaging with the field. The tourist guide of the game world doubles as a photography manual for the in-game photography age, featuring tutorials and excercises ranging from game screenshotting to computer programming for creative modding. Through the practical excercises, the project invites to rethink the game object as a space for creative, subversive and critical endeavours, which can be played differently, documented, reclaimed or modified through an artistic approach. Finally, the project draws inspiration from the works of artists who have explored the ‘metaplay’ of photographing game words instead of following the game rules and attempt to reach the goal of winning. The Photographer’s Guide to Los Santos is indebted to all the artists it features, but was particularly inspired by Gareth Damian Martin’s live streamed workshop Photography Tour of No Man’s Sky (realized for Now Play This Festival 2020), Total Refusal &amp; Ismaël Joffroy Chandoutis’s 2021 in-game lecture performance and guided tour Everyday Daylight (realized for the CCS Paris), and Alan Butler’s epic 2020 live endurance performance Witness to a Changing West (realized for Screen Walks) and his ‘Content Replication Assignments’. 1.2 Grand Theft Auto V Studies Los Santos is the Grand Theft Auto V’s fictional, parodic version of real-life Los Angeles. Just like Los Angeles is the global centre of film and commercial media production, Los Santos is the epicentre of in-game photography and machinima creation. While it may seem reductive to only focus on a single game to address the larger phenomenon of in-game photography, GTA V is the biggest source of creative outputs to date, with its extended open world and one of the largest community of active modders. Launched in 2013, the game contains a world map of more than 80 square kilometers of total area, which includes the urban area of the city of Los Santos and the rural area of Blaine County. This incredibly vast environment features a large desert region, dense forest, several mountains, beachside towns, on top of the large metropolis of Los Santos. The game simulates the everyday life of hundreds of individual NPCs (while it allegedly counts a population of over 4 million) as well as counting 28 animal species, and more than 800 buildings in GTA V are based on real-life landmarks. The size of the photorealistic simulation is only matched by the complexity of the game engine and its code, which - thanks to the effort of GTA V’s modding community - allows players to use the game world as a powerful tool to create new scenes, take controls of its algorithmic entities, modify cameras and reshaping the game into a movie set or a photo studio. GTA V Satellite Map by Manas Sharma 1.3 Grand Theft Auto V Tourism This guide allows players to explore the game environment following some of the most interesting artworks that have been created with(in) it. The guide is divided in thematic chapters that follow different artistic practices, taking place in different locations of the game environment, followed by different tutorials and exercises connected with the works and the space analyzed. Each selected work is presented by a curatorial statement, introducing the work and its artistic relevance. The work is accompanied by information on the in-game location from which it was produced, inviting the readers to reach the destination in Grand Theft Auto V through maps and indications. 1.4 Grand Theft Auto V Art Education Each thematic chapter features a tutorial section that introduces different techniques and strategies to capture images within Grand Theft Auto V. The chapters are thought to be experienced in order, as the tutorials at times rely on knowledge that is built on top of previous lessons. Each tutorial is accompanied by content replication assignments, in which the readers is invited to use the skills learnd from each chapter to recreate a work presented in that section.

GTA V is 100+ GB so it will take a day to download at average/slow internet connections) Download Script Hook V Go to the bin folder and copy dinput8.dll and ScriptHookV.dll files into your GTA V directory C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Grand Theft Auto V Download Script Hook V dot net Copy the ScriptHookVDotNet.asi file, ScriptHookVDotNet2.dll and ScriptHookVDotNet3.dll files into your GTA V directory C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Grand Theft Auto V Create a new folder in GTA V directory and call it “scripts”. Download and install Visual Studio Community (free version of VS) Open Visual Studio and check the .NET desktop development package and install it Run GTA V and test if Script Hook V is working by pressing F4. This should to toggle the console view. 5.4.1.2 Creating a Mod File Open Visual Studio Select File &gt; New &gt; Project Select Visual C# and Class Library (.NET Framework) Give a custom file name (e.g. moddingTutorial) Rename public class Class1 as “moddingTutorial” in the right panel Solution Explorer In the same panel go to References and click add References… &gt; Browse &gt; browse to Downloads Select ScriptHookedVDotNet &gt; ScriptHookVDotNet2.dll and ScriptHookVDotNet3.dll and add them Also add System.Windows.forms Also add System.Drawing In your code file add the following lines on top: using GTA; using GTA.Math; using System.Windows.Forms; using System.Drawing; using GTA.Native; Modify class moddingTutorial to the following: namespace moddingTutorial { public class moddingTutorial : Script { public moddingTutorial() { this.Tick += onTick; this.KeyUp += onKeyUp; this.KeyDown += onKeyDown; } private void onTick(object sender, EventArgs e) { } private void onKeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { } private void onKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { if (e.KeyCode == Keys.H) { Game.Player.ChangeModel(PedHash.Cat); } } } } Save file Go to Documents &gt; Visual Studio &gt; Project &gt; moddingTutorial &gt; moddingTutorial &gt; moddingTutorial.cs Copy the .cs file in the GTA V directory inside the scripts folder Open GTA V, run the game in Story Mode (mods are only allowed in single player mode, not in GTA Online) and press ‘H’ to see if the game turns your avatar into a cat Note: every time you make changes to your .cs file in the scripts folder you can hit F4 to open the console, type Reload() in the console for the program to reload the script and test again the changes. 5.4.1.3 onTick, onKeyUp and onKeyDown The main events of Script Hook V Dot Net are onTick, onKeyUp and onKeyDown. Script Hook V Dot Net will invoke your functions whenever an event is called. The code within the onTick brackets is executed every interval milliseconds (which is by default 0), meaning that the event will be executed at every frame, for as long as the game is running. private void onTick(object sender, EventArgs e) { //code here will be executed every frame (or per usef defined interval) } If your function is written inside onKeyDown (withiin the curly brackets following onKeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e){}), your code will be executed every time a key is pressed. If your function is written inside onKeyUp, your code will be executed every time a key is released. private void onKeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { //code here will be executed whenever a key is released } private void onKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { //code here will be executed whenever a key is pressed } We can specify which code is executed based on what keys are pressed/released private void onKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { if (e.KeyCode == Keys.H) { //code here will be executed whenever the key &#39;H&#39; is pressed } } 5.4.1.4 Change Player Model The player character is controlled as Game.Player. Game.Player can perform different functions, including changing the avatar model, and performing tasks. Change the 3D model of your character by using the ChangeModel function. The ChangeModel function needs a model ID, in order to load the model file of our game character. You can browse through this list of models to find the one you want to try: https://wiki.gtanet.work/index.php/Peds These models are all PedHashes, basically ID numbers within the PedHash group. Copy the name of the model below the image and add it to PedHash. For example if you choose the model Cat, you’ll need to write PedHash.Cat. To change the model of your player character into a cat you write the following function: Game.Player.ChangeModel(PedHash.Cat); 5.4.1.5 Tasks 5.5 Content Replication Assignment 5.5.1 Deercam reenactment Write a mod script to change your game character into a deer make it autonomously wander around Los Santos.
