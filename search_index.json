The Photographer’s Guide to Los Santos is an ongoing project that builds on top of a research on artistic practices within spaces of computer games, with a particular focus on in-game photography, machinima and digital visual arts. It follows some themes and ideas previously explored in the exhibition How to Win at Photography, while focusing more specifically on the relationship between computer games and photographic activities inside the world of Grand Theft Auto V. The idea of a guide refers to in-game photography as a form of ‘virtual tourism’ (Book, 2003), which was also the premise of an actual tourist guide published by Rough Guides in their 2019 Rough Guide to XBOX. Yet this guide project also understands the game world as a site for image production and artistic creation, turning the game into a destination for a ‘game art tourist’. The Photographer’s Guide to Los Santos presents the game environment of Grand Theft Auto V both as a space to explore and in which to create images, as well as a place to navigate and learn about some of the most important artworks that it has enabled to create. The project also brings together several experiences from teaching in-game photography as an artistic practice in different educational settings and institutions, compiling materials and tools for students and artists interested in engaging with the field. The tourist guide of the game world doubles as a photography manual for the in-game photography age, featuring tutorials and excercises ranging from game screenshotting to computer programming for creative modding. Through the practical excercises, the project invites to rethink the game object as a space for creative, subversive and critical endeavours, which can be played differently, documented, reclaimed or modified through an artistic approach. Finally, the project draws inspiration from the works of artists who have explored the ‘metaplay’ of photographing game words instead of following the game rules and attempt to reach the goal of winning. The Photographer’s Guide to Los Santos is indebted to all the artists it features, but was particularly inspired by Gareth Damian Martin’s live streamed workshop Photography Tour of No Man’s Sky (realized for Now Play This Festival 2020), Total Refusal &amp; Ismaël Joffroy Chandoutis’s 2021 in-game lecture performance and guided tour Everyday Daylight (realized for the CCS Paris), and Alan Butler’s epic 2020 live endurance performance Witness to a Changing West (realized for Screen Walks) and his ‘Content Replication Assignments’. 1.2 Grand Theft Auto V Studies Los Santos is the Grand Theft Auto V’s fictional, parodic version of real-life Los Angeles. Just like Los Angeles is the global centre of film and commercial media production, Los Santos is the epicentre of in-game photography and machinima creation. While it may seem reductive to only focus on a single game to address the larger phenomenon of in-game photography, GTA V is the biggest source of creative outputs to date, with its extended open world and one of the largest community of active modders. Launched in 2013, the game contains a world map of more than 80 square kilometers of total area, which includes the urban area of the city of Los Santos and the rural area of Blaine County. This incredibly vast environment features a large desert region, dense forest, several mountains, beachside towns, on top of the large metropolis of Los Santos. The game simulates the everyday life of hundreds of individual NPCs (while it allegedly counts a population of over 4 million) as well as counting 28 animal species, and more than 800 buildings in GTA V are based on real-life landmarks. The size of the photorealistic simulation is only matched by the complexity of the game engine and its code, which - thanks to the effort of GTA V’s modding community - allows players to use the game world as a powerful tool to create new scenes, take controls of its algorithmic entities, modify cameras and reshaping the game into a movie set or a photo studio. GTA V Satellite Map by Manas Sharma 1.3 Grand Theft Auto V Tourism This guide allows players to explore the game environment following some of the most interesting artworks that have been created with(in) it. The guide is divided in thematic chapters that follow different artistic practices, taking place in different locations of the game environment, followed by different tutorials and exercises connected with the works and the space analyzed. Each selected work is presented by a curatorial statement, introducing the work and its artistic relevance. The work is accompanied by information on the in-game location from which it was produced, inviting the readers to reach the destination in Grand Theft Auto V through maps and indications. 1.4 Grand Theft Auto V Art Education Each thematic chapter features a tutorial section that introduces different techniques and strategies to capture images within Grand Theft Auto V. The chapters are thought to be experienced in order, as the tutorials at times rely on knowledge that is built on top of previous lessons. Each tutorial is accompanied by content replication assignments, in which the readers is invited to use the skills learnd from each chapter to recreate a work presented in that section.

GTA V is 100+ GB so it will take a few hours depending on your internet connections) Download Script Hook V, go to the bin folder and copy dinput8.dll and ScriptHookV.dll files into your GTA V directory C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Grand Theft Auto V Download Script Hook V dot net, copy the ScriptHookVDotNet.asi file, ScriptHookVDotNet2.dll and ScriptHookVDotNet3.dll files into your GTA V directory C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Grand Theft Auto V Create a new folder in GTA V directory and call it “scripts”. Download and install Visual Studio Community (free version of VS). Open Visual Studio and check the .NET desktop development package and install it Run GTA V and test if Script Hook V is working by pressing F4. This should toggle the console view. 5.4.1.2 Creating a Mod File Open Visual Studio Select File &gt; New &gt; Project Select Visual C# and Class Library (.NET Framework) Give a custom file name (e.g. moddingTutorial) Rename public class Class1 as “moddingTutorial” in the right panel Solution Explorer In the same panel go to References and click add References… &gt; Browse &gt; browse to Downloads Select ScriptHookedVDotNet &gt; ScriptHookVDotNet2.dll and ScriptHookVDotNet3.dll and add them Also add System.Windows.forms Also add System.Drawing In your code file add the following lines on top: using GTA; using GTA.Math; using System.Windows.Forms; using System.Drawing; using GTA.Native; Modify class moddingTutorial to the following: namespace moddingTutorial { public class moddingTutorial : Script { public moddingTutorial() { this.Tick += onTick; this.KeyUp += onKeyUp; this.KeyDown += onKeyDown; } private void onTick(object sender, EventArgs e) { } private void onKeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { } private void onKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { if (e.KeyCode == Keys.H) { Game.Player.ChangeModel(PedHash.Cat); } } } } Save file Go to Documents &gt; Visual Studio &gt; Project &gt; moddingTutorial &gt; moddingTutorial &gt; moddingTutorial.cs Copy the .cs file in the GTA V directory inside the scripts folder Open GTA V, run the game in Story Mode (mods are only allowed in single player mode, not in GTA Online) and press ‘H’ to see if the game turns your avatar into a cat Note: every time you make changes to your .cs file in the scripts folder you can hit F4 to open the console, type Reload() in the console for the program to reload the script and test again the changes. 5.4.1.3 onTick, onKeyUp and onKeyDown The main events of Script Hook V Dot Net are onTick, onKeyUp and onKeyDown. Script Hook V Dot Net will invoke your functions whenever an event is called. The code within the onTick brackets is executed every interval milliseconds (which is by default 0), meaning that the event will be executed at every frame, for as long as the game is running. private void onTick(object sender, EventArgs e) { //code here will be executed every frame (or per usef defined interval) } If your function is written inside onKeyDown (withiin the curly brackets following onKeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e){}), your code will be executed every time a key is pressed. If your function is written inside onKeyUp, your code will be executed every time a key is released. private void onKeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { //code here will be executed whenever a key is released } private void onKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { //code here will be executed whenever a key is pressed } We can specify which code is executed based on what keys are pressed/released private void onKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) { if (e.KeyCode == Keys.H) { //code here will be executed whenever the key &#39;H&#39; is pressed } } 5.4.1.4 Change Player Model The player character is controlled as Game.Player. Game.Player can perform different functions, including changing the avatar model, and performing tasks. Change the 3D model of your character by using the ChangeModel function. The function needs a model ID, in order to load the model file of our game character. You can browse through this list of models to find the one you want to try: https://wiki.gtanet.work/index.php/Peds These models are all PedHashes, basically ID numbers within the PedHash group. Copy the name of the model below the image and add it to PedHash. For example if you choose the model Cat, you’ll need to write PedHash.Cat. To change the model of your player character into a cat you can write the following function: Game.Player.ChangeModel(PedHash.Cat); add it in your .cs file in the onKeyDown event, triggered by the pressing of the ‘h’ key: Example code using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using System.Threading.Tasks; using GTA; using GTA.Math; using System.Windows.Forms; using System.Drawing; using GTA.Native; namespace moddingTutorial { public class moddingTutorial : Script { public moddingTutorial() { this.Tick += onTick; this.KeyUp += onKeyUp; this.KeyDown += onKeyDown; } private void onTick(object sender, EventArgs e) //this function gets executed continuously { } private void onKeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)//everything inside here is executed only when we release a key { } private void onKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) //everything inside here is executed only when we press a key { //when pressing &#39;H&#39; if(e.KeyCode == Keys.H) { //change player char into a different model Game.Player.ChangeModel(PedHash.Cat); } } } } 5.4.1.5 Tasks Our character can be controlled by our script, and given actions that override manual control of the player. These actions are called Tasks and in order to assign tasks to our characters we have to define our Game.Player as Game.Player.Character. The Game.Player.Character code gets the specific model the player is controlling. Now we can give tasks to the character by adding the Task function: Game.Player.Character.Task. 5.5 Content Replication Assignment 5.5.1 Deercam reenactment Write a mod script to change your game character into a deer by pressing a key, and make it autonomously wander around Los Santos by pressing another key.

Peds are an entity like Props or Vehicles and can be created, assigned different model textures, equipped with weapons and controlled through different tasks. 6.3.1.2 Spawn a new NPC A GTA V Ped can be created by the World.CreatePed function. This takes two parameters: an ID to assign the 3D model and textures, and the location where the Ped is created. The model IDs are the same we used in the previous tutorial, when we changed our character’s appearance to a cat. A list of all available models can be found here. PedHash.Cat, PedHash.Deer, PedHash.AviSchwartzmanare all possible IDs we can assign to the NPC we want to create. We can create a new model variable, which we will name ‘myPedModel’ and assign it a model ID: Models myPedModel = &quot;PedHash.AviSchwartzman&quot;; The location where the NPC is created through a vector3 data type, which represents a vector in 3D space. This basically means a point that contains X, Y and Z coordinates. We can give absolute coordinates, making the Ped appear at a specific location in the game, but we can also use a location relative to our position in the game. In order not to risk making a Ped appear somewhere completely outside of our view – on some mountain or in the sea – let’s look at a vector3 that points to a position in front of the player. We want to establish the player withGame.Player.Character, followed by a function that retireve the player position within the game world. That’s called by using GetOffsetInWorldCoords, which takes a vector3. The values of the X, Y and Z of the vector 3 offset the location based on the origin point represented by the player. Therefore, we can move the place where we want the Ped to appear by adding values to the X axis (left or right of player), Y axis (ahead or behind the player), and Z axis (above or below the player). To make a Ped appear in front of the player we can create a vector3 data type with 0 for X, 5 for Y and 0 for Z: new Vector3(0, 5, 0). Let’s make a vector3 variable, which we will name ‘myPedSpawnPosition’, assign it the values above for X, Y and Z coordinates from the player position. Vector3 myPedSpawnPosition = Game.Player.Character.GetOffsetInWorldCoords(new Vector3(0, 5, 0)); Now we can use the model and the position variables to spawn the NPC in front of the player. We’ll create a Ped named ‘myPed1’ and use the World.CreatePed function with the two variables as parameters: var myPed1 = World.CreatePed(myPedModel, myPedSpawnPosition); Example code using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using System.Threading.Tasks; using GTA; using GTA.Math; using System.Windows.Forms; using System.Drawing; using GTA.Native; namespace moddingTutorial { public class moddingTutorial : Script { public moddingTutorial() { this.Tick += onTick; this.KeyUp += onKeyUp; this.KeyDown += onKeyDown; } private void onTick(object sender, EventArgs e) //this function gets executed continuously { } private void onKeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)//everything inside here is executed only when we release a key { } private void onKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) //everything inside here is executed only when we press a key { //when pressing &#39;K&#39; if(e.KeyCode == Keys.K) { //select a model and store it in a variable Models myPedModel = &quot;PedHash.AviSchwartzman&quot;; //create a position relative to the player Vector3 myPedSpawnPosition = Game.Player.Character.GetOffsetInWorldCoords(new Vector3(0, 5, 0)); //create a Ped with the chosen model, spawning at the chosen position var myPed1 = World.CreatePed(myPedModel, myPedSpawnPosition); } } } } 6.3.1.3 Give Tasks to NPCs A Ped can be given a task using the Task function, just like we did in the previous tutorial for the player character. myPed1.Task.WanderAround(); Some tasks involve interacting with other characters (Peds or Game.Player.Character) or take different parameters like positions (vector3), duration (in milliseconds), and other data types. We can give our NPC the task to fight against the player by using the FightAgainst function, which requires a Ped parameter – which in the case of the player is expressed as Game.Player.Character. myPed1.Task.FightAgainst(Game.Player.Character); //give npc task to fight against player Try to replace the task to “fight against” with “flee from (player)” , “hands up”, “jump”… or some of the other available tasks See the TaskInvoker list for possible tasks, or click on the list of available tasks below.

This function needs an entity and X, Y and Z coordinate to teleport to. We need to know the exact coordinates of the locations we want to teleport to, but thankfully the modding community forums provide lists with all available coordinates we can teleport to.
