# Hyperrealism 

//intro to the artistic current of photorealism and hyperrealism in painting and drawing, connected to the idea of photorealism and simulation in games (attempt to simulate life itself, not just photography), relationship between the game and the physical world, the way virtual spaces influence and shape society (training self driving cars in GTA V, CGI shaping architecture of buildings and object...), the blurrying of the lines between virtual and physical...

### Setting Camera Views {-}
GTA V has 4 default camera views, which can be switched by pressing the ```V``` key on PC.
To set a specific camera view we can use the native function ```SET_FOLLOW_PED_CAM_VIEW_MOD```, followed by number 0, 1, 2 or 4 to establish the desired point of view:

+ 0 - Third Person View - Close
+ 1 - Third Person View - Mid
+ 2 - Third Person View - Far
+ 4 - First Person View 

Switch to first person view:
```cs
Function.Call(Hash.SET_FOLLOW_PED_CAM_VIEW_MODE, 4); 
```

### Scripting Cinematic Fade Out/ In {-}

Script Hook has native functions to create a fead to/from black. The function hash are ```DO_SCREEN_FADE_OUT``` and ```DO_SCREEN_FADE_IN``` and they are followed by the number of milliseconds to go from full black to showing the scene and viceversa.

Let's create a fade to black over 3 seconds when we press the letter key 'O':
```cs
if (e.KeyCode == Keys.O)
{
    Function.Call(Hash.DO_SCREEN_FADE_OUT, 3000);
}
```

And a fade over 3 seconds when we press the letter key 'I':
```cs
if (e.KeyCode == Keys.I)
{
    Function.Call(Hash.DO_SCREEN_FADE_IN, 3000);
}
```

We could also create an automated check in our onTick loop, which keeps seeing if the screen has been faded to black. We can use the native function ```IS_SCREEN_FADED_OUT``` which is a boolean data type. This means it will return either true or false. If it returns true, it means the screen has been faded out. 

Let's add an If statement in our onTick loop to chek if the screen has been faded to black, and if so we call a fade in over 3 second:
```cs
if (Function.Call<bool>(Hash.IS_SCREEN_FADED_OUT))
{
    Wait(500);
    GTA.Native.Function.Call(Hash.DO_SCREEN_FADE_IN, 3000);
}
```

Now if you try to hit the 'O' key, the screen will fade out, and then it will automatically fade in again.


### Natural Vision Evolved Mod {-}

Natural Vision Evolved is a graphic mod develped by [Jamal Rashid, aka Razed](https://www.razedmods.com/). This mod enhances GTA V's lighting, weather effects, ambient colours, world textures, building models, pushing the photo-realism and cinematic looks. While the mod contains settings for different hardware settings, it's recommended to have a relatively powerful PC with a good graphic card. [Here](https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/requirements/gta-5-naturalvision-remastered/16594) you can find minimum and recommended requirements for Natural Vision Evolved mod.

Setup:

+ Go to razedmods.com/gta-v and download Natural Vision Evolved (6.2 Gb).

+ Go to [openiv.com/](https://openiv.com/) and download Open IV, Open 'ovisetup' and install Open IV on your computer.

+ Open the Open IV app and select GTA V Windows. Choose Grand Theft Auto V folder ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V```

+ Once Open IV is open, go to your file window select the ```Tools``` menu on top of the window, and select ```ASI Manager```. In ```ASI Manager``` install all options: ASI Loader, OpenIV.ASI and openCamera.

+ Select ```Tools``` again and click ```Options```. Click on the ```"mods" folder``` tab and select ```Allow edit mode only for archive inside "mods" folder```. Click ```Close```.

+ Back in Open IV, select ```Edit mode``` at the top right of the window. Select ```OK``` on the pop up window. 

+ Now you can add your mod to the mods folder.

+ Open the NVE mod folder and copy the subfolder containing the settings you want (low/medium/ultra graphics) to your GTA V directory folder ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V```.

+ Go back to your downloads and inside the NVE folder select the installation files and open number 1 and 2 with Open IV in the correct order. Always choose to select "mod" folder and select install.

+ Go back to your downloads and inside the NVE folder you can choose some optional addons. Install/Uninstall them with Open IV as above Always choose to select "mod" folder and select install.

+ Open GTA V, press ```ESC``` to bring up the menu and go to ```SETTINGS```. Adjust the graphics quality, making sure ```Shader Quality```, ```Particle Quality``` and ```Post FX```are set to ```<Very High>```. Restart the game to make change in effect.
