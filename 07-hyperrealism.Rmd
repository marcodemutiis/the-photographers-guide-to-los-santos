# Hyperrealism 

//intro to the artistic current of photorealism and hyperrealism in painting and drawing, connected to the idea of photorealism and simulation in games (attempt to simulate life itself, not just photography), relationship between the game and the physical world, the way virtual spaces influence and shape society (training self driving cars in GTA V, CGI shaping architecture of buildings and object...), the blurrying of the lines between virtual and physical...

### Setting Camera Views {-}

GTA V has 4 default camera views, which can be switched by pressing the ```V``` key on PC.
To set a specific camera view we can use the native function ```SET_FOLLOW_PED_CAM_VIEW_MOD```, followed by number 0, 1, 2 or 4 to establish the desired point of view:

+ 0 - Third Person View - Close
+ 1 - Third Person View - Mid
+ 2 - Third Person View - Far
+ 4 - First Person View 

Switch to first person view:
```cs
Function.Call(Hash.SET_FOLLOW_PED_CAM_VIEW_MODE, 4); 
```


### Setting the Time of the Day {-}

We can control the time and the light for our shots to the second in GTA V. We can specify the exact time of the day with the native function ```SET_CLOCK_TIME```, followed by hour, minute and second. Note that the sun sets at 5:30 a.m. and goes down at 8 p.m.

Set the imte of the day to 15:45:
```cs
Function.Call(Hash.SET_CLOCK_TIME, 15, 45, 00);
```

```{r fig.align='left', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html'), fig.link=''}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/scriptingGifs/setTime.gif', dpi = NA)
```



### Controlling the Weather {-}

We can choose among the following weather options using the native function ```SET_WEATHER_TYPE_NOW_PERSIST```:

"CLEAR"
"EXTRASUNNY"
"CLOUDS"
"OVERCAST"
"RAIN"
"CLEARING"
"THUNDER"
"SMOG"
"FOGGY"
"XMAS"
"SNOWLIGHT"
"BLIZZARD"

Set the weather to blizzard:
```cs
Function.Call(Hash.SET_WEATHER_TYPE_NOW_PERSIST, "BLIZZARD");
```

```{r fig.align='left', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html'), fig.link=''}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/scriptingGifs/setWeather.gif', dpi = NA)
```

	
### Scripting Cinematic Fade Out / In {-}

Script Hook has native functions to create a fead to/from black. The function hash are ```DO_SCREEN_FADE_OUT``` and ```DO_SCREEN_FADE_IN``` and they are followed by the number of milliseconds to go from full black to showing the scene and viceversa.

Let's create a fade to black over 3 seconds when we press the letter key 'O':
```cs
if (e.KeyCode == Keys.O)
{
    Function.Call(Hash.DO_SCREEN_FADE_OUT, 3000);
}
```

And a fade over 3 seconds when we press the letter key 'I':
```cs
if (e.KeyCode == Keys.I)
{
    Function.Call(Hash.DO_SCREEN_FADE_IN, 3000);
}
```

We could also create an automated check in our onTick loop, which keeps seeing if the screen has been faded to black. We can use the native function ```IS_SCREEN_FADED_OUT``` which is a boolean data type. This means it will return either true or false. If it returns true, it means the screen has been faded out. 

Let's add an "if" statement in our onTick loop to chek if the screen has been faded to black, and if so we teleport somewhere else and we call a fade in over 3 second:
```cs
if (Function.Call<bool>(Hash.IS_SCREEN_FADED_OUT))
{
    Function.Call(Hash.SET_ENTITY_COORDS, Game.Player.Character, -1374.881f, -1398.835f, 6.141f, 0, 0, 1);
    Wait(500);
    GTA.Native.Function.Call(Hash.DO_SCREEN_FADE_IN, 3000);
}
```

Now if you try to hit the 'O' key, the screen will fade out, and then it will automatically fade in again.

### Natural Vision Evolved Mod {-}

Natural Vision Evolved (NVE) is a graphic mod develped by [Jamal Rashid, aka Razed](https://www.razedmods.com/). This mod enhances GTA V's lighting, weather effects, ambient colours, world textures, building models, pushing the photo-realism and cinematic looks. While the mod contains settings for different hardware settings, it's recommended to have a relatively powerful PC with a good graphic card. [Here](https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/requirements/gta-5-naturalvision-remastered/16594) you can find minimum and recommended requirements for Natural Vision Evolved mod.

Installation and setup:

+ Go to [razedmods.com/gta-v](https://www.razedmods.com/gta-v) and download Natural Vision Evolved (6.2 Gb).

+ Go to [openiv.com/](https://openiv.com/) and download Open IV, Open 'ovisetup' and install Open IV on your computer.

+ Select GTA V Windows. Choose Grand Theft Auto V folder ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V```

+ Once Open IV is open, go to your file window select the ```Tools``` menu on top of the window, and select ```ASI Manager```. In ```ASI Manager``` install all options: ASI Loader, OpenIV.ASI and openCamera.

+ Select ```Tools``` again and click ```Options```. Click on the ```"mods" folder``` tab and select ```Allow edit mode only for archive inside "mods" folder```. Click ```Close```.

+ Select ```Edit mode``` at the top right of the window. Select ```OK``` on the pop up window. 

+ Now you can add your mod to the mods folder.

+ Open the NVE mod folder, extract and select NaturalVision Installer PART ONE and drag it to Open IV. Install the file and select "mod folder" when asked to choose. After that is complete, extract and select NaturalVision Installer PART TWO and drag it to Open IV. Install the file and select "mod folder" when asked to choose. The Installers have to be executed in order: first do PART ONE, and then do PART TWO.

+ Go back to your downloads and inside the NVE folder you can choose some optional addons. Install/Uninstall them with Open IV as above. Always choose to select "mod" folder and select install.

+ Open GTA V, press ```ESC``` to bring up the menu and go to ```SETTINGS```. Adjust the graphics quality, making sure ```Shader Quality```, ```Particle Quality``` and ```Post FX```are set to ```<Very High>```. Restart the game to make change in effect. More details about installation are provided in the README file inside the NVE zip folder.

### ReShade {-}
ReShade is a generic post-processing injector for games and video software developed by crosire.
//install reshade + presets tutorial

+ Go to [reshade.me](http://static.reshade.me/) and download the latest version

+ Open ReShade Setup and select Browse and navigate to your Grand Theft Auto V folder and select GTA 5.exe. Leave Direct X 10/11/12 checked and click Next. When asked to select presets to install click on Skip. 

+ Select SweetFX by CeeJay.dk and all the effect packages you want to install (OtisFX by Otis_Inf and CobraFX by SirCobra are particularly interesting for simulation of analogue photography, including depth of field) and complete installation.

+ Go to GTA 5 Redux page and download the latest GTA5_REDUX.zip folder. This contains different presets to change the appearance of the game. Note that the file is more than 3 GB.

+ Unzip the conent of the .zip folder and go to GTA_5_REDUX_RESHADE folder. Select all the files and copy them. Go to your Grand Theft Auto V folder > reshade-shaders, and create a Presets folder. Paste the preset files from GTA_5_REDUX_RESHADE in the Presets folder.

+ Run GTA V and press the ```Home key``` to bring up the menu. The first time you bring up Reshade, it will offer to give a short tutorial on how to choose and modify the presets.

+ Bring up a preset and mess around with its setting to see how it affects the visuals of the game. Thanks to different effects and presets, the aesthetics of the game world can be configured to obtain looks that are completely different from the original graphics created by the deleopers and designers of the game.
