#### Preparation and Setup

+ Install Windows 11

+ Download and install [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) (with a copy of GTA V or to buy the game if you do not have it. GTA V is 100+ GB so it will take a day to download at average/slow internet connections)

+ Download [Script Hook V](https://store.steampowered.com/about/)
Go to the bin folder and copy dinput8.dll, NativeTrainer.asi and ScriptHookV.dll files into your GTA V directory (\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V)
