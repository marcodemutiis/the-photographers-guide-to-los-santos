## Tutorial {-}

### Scripting Introduction {-} 

### Preparation and Setup {-}

+ Install Windows 11

+ Download and install [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) (with a copy of GTA V or buy the game if you do not have it. GTA V is 100+ GB so it will take a few hours depending on your internet connections)

+ Download [Script Hook V](https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/script-hook-v), go to the bin folder and copy ```dinput8.dll``` and ```ScriptHookV.dll``` files into your GTA V directory ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V```

+ Download [Script Hook V dot net](https://github.com/crosire/scripthookvdotnet/releases), copy the ```ScriptHookVDotNet.asi``` file, ```ScriptHookVDotNet2.dll``` and ```ScriptHookVDotNet3.dll``` files into your GTA V directory ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto V```

+ Create a new folder in GTA V directory and call it “scripts”.

+ Download and install [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) (free version of VS). Open Visual Studio and check the .NET desktop development package and install it

+ Run GTA V and test if Script Hook V is working by pressing ```F4```. This should toggle the console view. Try to type Help() and press ``ÈNTER``` to get a list of available commands.

```{r fig.align='left', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html'), fig.link=''}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/scriptingGifs/console.gif', dpi = NA)
```

+ It's also recommended to use a completed [game save file](https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/100-save-game) to skip the story mode and compulsory introductory mission. Extract the content of the file and copy both files ```SGTAXXXXX``` and ```SGTAXXXXX.bak``` in ```Documents/GTA V/Profiles/YYYYYYYY/```. Once the files are there, you will be able to load the game state by running GTA V and navigating to GAME > Load Game and select the 100% game file.

```{r fig.align='left', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html'), fig.link=''}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/loadSaveGame.png', dpi = NA)
```


#### Creating a Mod File {-}

+ Open Visual Studio

+ Select File > New > Project

+ Select Visual C# and Class Library (.NET Framework)


```{r fig.align='left', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html'), fig.link=''}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/scriptingGifs/ScriptNewProject.png', dpi = NA)
```


+ Give a custom file name (e.g. moddingTutorial)

+ Rename public class Class1 as “moddingTutorial” in the right panel Solution Explorer and click Yes on the pop-up window 

+ In the same panel go to References and click add References… 


```{r fig.align='left', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html'), fig.link=''}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/scriptingGifs/ScriptAddRefs.png', dpi = NA)
```



+ Click on > Browse > browse to Downloads 

+ Select ScriptHookedVDotNet > ```ScriptHookVDotNet2.dll``` and ```ScriptHookVDotNet3.dll``` and add them


```{r fig.align='left', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html'), fig.link=''}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/scriptingGifs/ScriptAddRefsSHVDN.png', dpi = NA)
```



+ Go to > Assemblies and search for "forms" and select ```System.Windows.forms```

+ Search for "drawing" and select ```System.Drawing```


```{r fig.align='left', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html'), fig.link=''}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/scriptingGifs/ScriptAddRefsFormsDrawing.png', dpi = NA)
```



+ In your code file add the following lines on top:
```cs
using GTA;
using GTA.Math;
using System.Windows.Forms;
using System.Drawing;
using GTA.Native;
```

+ Modify class moddingTutorial to the following:
```cs
namespace moddingTutorial
{
  public class moddingTutorial : Script
  {
	  public moddingTutorial()
	  {
		  this.Tick += onTick;
      this.KeyUp += onKeyUp;
      this.KeyDown += onKeyDown;
	  }
	
	  private void onTick(object sender, EventArgs e)
	  {
	  }
	
	  private void onKeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)
	  {
	  }
 
	  private void onKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)
	  {
	  	if (e.KeyCode == Keys.H)
	  	{
			  Game.Player.ChangeModel(PedHash.Cat); 
		  }
	  } 
  }
}
```

+ Save file

+ Go to Documents > Visual Studio > Project > moddingTutorial > moddingTutorial > ```moddingTutorial.cs```

+ Copy the .cs file in the GTA V directory inside the scripts folder

+ Open GTA V, run the game in Story Mode (mods are only allowed in single player mode, not in GTA Online) and press ‘H’ to see if the game turns your avatar into a cat

```{r fig.align='left', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html'), fig.link=''}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/scriptingGifs/pressHtoCat.gif', dpi = NA)
```

+ Note: every time you make changes to your .cs file in the scripts folder you can hit ```F4``` to open the console, type ```Reload()``` in the console for the program to reload the script and test again the changes.


#### onTick, onKeyUp and onKeyDown {-}
The main events of Script Hook V Dot Net are onTick, onKeyUp and onKeyDown. Script Hook V Dot Net will invoke your functions whenever an event is called.

The code within the onTick brackets is executed every interval milliseconds (which is by default 0), meaning that the event will be executed at every frame, for as long as the game is running.

```cs
 private void onTick(object sender, EventArgs e)
 {
      	//code here will be executed every frame (or per usef defined interval)
 }
```

If your function is written inside onKeyDown (withiin the curly brackets following onKeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e){}), your code will be executed every time a key is pressed. If your function is written inside onKeyUp, your code will be executed every time a key is released.

```cs
private void onKeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)
{
      //code here will be executed whenever a key is released
}

private void onKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)
{
      //code here will be executed whenever a key is pressed
} 
```

We can specify which code is executed based on what keys are pressed/released

```cs
private void onKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)
{
	if (e.KeyCode == Keys.H)
	{
		//code here will be executed whenever the key 'H' is pressed 
	}
} 
```



### Change Player Model {-}

The player character is controlled as ```Game.Player```. ```Game.Player``` can perform different functions, including changing the avatar model.

Change the 3D model of your character by using the ```ChangeModel``` function.
The function needs a model ID, in order to load the model file of our game character.
You can browse through [this list of models](https://gtahash.ru/skins/) to find the one you want to try (note: not all models seem to load properly).


```{r fig.align='left', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html'), fig.link='https://wiki.gtanet.work/index.php/Peds'}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/peds.png', dpi = NA)
```

These models are all PedHashes, basically ID numbers within the PedHash group. Copy the name of the model below the image and add it to PedHash.
For example if you choose the model Poodle, you’ll need to write ```PedHash.Poodle```.

To change the model of your player character into a poodle you can write the following function:
```cs
Game.Player.ChangeModel(PedHash.Poodle);
```
add it in your .cs file in the onKeyDown event, triggered by the pressing of the 'h' key:

<details>
  <summary>Example code</summary>

```cs
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
 
using GTA;
using GTA.Math;
using System.Windows.Forms;
using System.Drawing;
using GTA.Native;
 
 
namespace moddingTutorial
{
    public class moddingTutorial : Script
    {
		public moddingTutorial()
		{
			this.Tick += onTick;
			this.KeyUp += onKeyUp;
			this.KeyDown += onKeyDown;
		}
 
		private void onTick(object sender, EventArgs e) //this function gets executed continuously 
		{
		}
 
		private void onKeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)//everything inside here is executed only when we release a key
		{
		}
 
		private void onKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e) //everything inside here is executed only when we press a key
		{
			//when pressing 'H'
			if(e.KeyCode == Keys.H)
			{
				//change player char into a different model
				Game.Player.ChangeModel(PedHash.Poodle); 
			}
		}
	}
}

```
</details>


Try to select different models and assign them to different keys to change the model of your character. Use keys that are not already implemented in the game controls to avoid clashes with built in operations. 


```{r fig.align='left', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html'), fig.link=''}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/scriptingGifs/changeCharModel.gif', dpi = NA)
```


### Tasks {-}

Our character can be controlled by our script, and given actions that override manual control of the player. These actions are called _Tasks_ and in order to assign tasks to our characters we have to define our ```Game.Player``` as ```Game.Player.Character```. The ```Game.Player.Character``` code gets the specific model the player is controlling.

Now we can give tasks to the character by adding the ```Task``` function: ```Game.Player.Character.Task```.

Finally we can specify what task to give the character by choosing a task from [TaskInvoker list](https://nitanmarcel.github.io/shvdn-docs.github.io/class_g_t_a_1_1_task_invoker.html) of possible actions.

Jump:
```cs
Game.Player.Character.Task.Jump();
```

```{r fig.align='left', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html'), fig.link=''}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/scriptingGifs/jump.gif', dpi = NA)
```


Wander around:
```cs
Game.Player.Character.Task.WanderAround();
```

```{r fig.align='left', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html'), fig.link=''}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/scriptingGifs/wanderAround.gif', dpi = NA)
```


Hands up for 3000 milliseconds:
```cs
Game.Player.Character.Task.HandsUp(3000);
```

```{r fig.align='left', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html'), fig.link=''}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/scriptingGifs/handsUp.gif', dpi = NA)
```

Turn towards the camera:
```cs
Game.Player.Character.Task.TurnTo(GameplayCamera.Position);
```

```{r fig.align='left', echo=FALSE, include=identical(knitr:::pandoc_to(), 'html'), fig.link=''}
knitr::include_graphics('assets/scriptingGifs/turnTo.gif', dpi = NA)
```

Some of the tasks are temporary and accept a time parameter (in milliseconds). Others are persistent, meaning they will keep being executed until the task is actively stopped. To stop a task you can use the ```ClearAllImmediately();``` command:

```cs
Game.Player.Task.ClearAllImmediately();
```


### Task Sequences {-}

You can create sequence of multiple tasks by using ```TaskSequence``` and the ```PerformSequence``` function.
Create a new ```TaskSequence``` with a custom name, add tasks to it with ```AddTask```, close the sequence with ```Close``` and then call ```Task.PerformSequence``` to perform the sequence.

```cs
TaskSequence mySeq = new TaskSequence();
mySeq.AddTask.Jump();
mySeq.AddTask.HandsUp(3000);
mySeq.Close();
				
Game.Player.Character.Task.PerformSequence(mySeq);
```

### Random {-}

We can add randomness by using a randomly generated number, which makes things outside of thepredefined programme controlled by us and introduces more autonomous behaviours. We use the ```Random```function to create a randomly generated number between our minimum and maximum parameter (if only one parameter is inserted, the minimum is 0).

```cs
Random rnd = new Random(); 
int month = rnd.Next(1, 13); // creates a number between 1 and 12 
int dice = rnd.Next(1, 7); // creates a number between 1 and 6 
int card = rnd.Next(52); // creates a number between 0 and 51
```

Let's create a number to generate a random duration between 1 and 6 seconds, for the ```HandsUp``` task.
```cs
Random rnd = new Random(); 
int waitingTime = rnd.Next(1, 7);
Game.Player.Character.Task.HandsUp(waitingTime * 1000);
```

### Subtitles and Notifications {-}

Generate subtitles with a custom text string and duration (in milliseconds): 
```cs
UI.ShowSubtitle("Hello World", 3000);
```

Generate a notification with a custom text string:
```cs
UI.Notify("Hello World");
```


## Content Replication Assignment {-}

### Deercam reenactment {-}

Write a mod script to change your game character into a deer by pressing a key, and make it autonomously wander around Los Santos by pressing another key.
