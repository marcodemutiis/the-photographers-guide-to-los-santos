### Setting Camera Views {-}
GTA V has 4 default camera views, which can be switched by pressing the ```V``` key on PC.
To set a specific camera view we can use the native function ```SET_FOLLOW_PED_CAM_VIEW_MOD```, followed by number 0, 1, 2 or 4 to establish the desired point of view:

+ 0 - Third Person View - Close
+ 1 - Third Person View - Mid
+ 2 - Third Person View - Far
+ 4 - First Person View 

Switch to first person view:
```cs
Function.Call(Hash.SET_FOLLOW_PED_CAM_VIEW_MODE, 4); 
```

### Scripting Cinematic Fade Out/ In {-}

Script Hook has native functions to create a fead to/from black. The function hash are ```DO_SCREEN_FADE_OUT``` and ```DO_SCREEN_FADE_IN``` and they are followed by the number of milliseconds to go from full black to showing the scene and viceversa.

Let's create a fade to black over 3 seconds when we press the letter key 'O':
```cs
if (e.KeyCode == Keys.O)
{
    Function.Call(Hash.DO_SCREEN_FADE_OUT, 3000);
}
```

And a fade over 3 seconds when we press the letter key 'I':
```cs
if (e.KeyCode == Keys.I)
{
    Function.Call(Hash.DO_SCREEN_FADE_IN, 3000);
}
```

We could also create an automated check in our onTick loop, which keeps seeing if the screen has been faded to black. We can use the native function ```IS_SCREEN_FADED_OUT``` which is a boolean data type. This means it will return either true or false. If it returns true, it means the screen has been faded out. 

Let's add an If statement in our onTick loop to chek if the screen has been faded to black, and if so we call a fade in over 3 second:
```cs
if (Function.Call<bool>(Hash.IS_SCREEN_FADED_OUT))
{
    GTA.Native.Function.Call(Hash.DO_SCREEN_FADE_IN, 3000);
}
```

Now if you try to hit the 'O' key, the screen will fade out, and then it will automatically fade in again.
