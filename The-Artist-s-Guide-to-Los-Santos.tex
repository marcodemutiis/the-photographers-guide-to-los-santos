\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{About The Photographer's Guide to Los Santos}

The Photographer's Guide to Los Santos sits between a touristic guide and a photography manual, and between an exhibition catalogue and a peak behind the scenes of artwork creation.

The Photographer's Guide to Los Santos is an ongoing project that builds on top of a research on artistic practices within spaces of computer games, with a particular focus on in-game photography, machinima and digital visual arts. It follows some themes and ideas previously explored in the exhibition \href{https://www.howtowinat.photography/}{\emph{How to Win at Photography}}, while focusing more specifically on the relationship between computer games and photographic activities inside the world of Grand Theft Auto V.

The idea of a guide refers to in-game photography as a form of `virtual tourism' (\href{https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=538182}{Book, 2003}), which was also the premise of an actual tourist guide published by Rough Guides in their 2019 \href{https://www.roughguides.com/articles/introduction-to-the-rough-guide-to-xbox/}{\emph{Rough Guide to XBOX}}. Yet this guide project also understands the game world as a site for image production and artistic creation, turning the game into a destination for a `game art tourist'. The Photographer's Guide to Los Santos presents the game environment of Grand Theft Auto V both as a space to explore and in which to create images, as well as a place to navigate and learn about some of the most important artworks that it has enabled to create.

The project also brings together several experiences from teaching in-game photography as an artistic practice in different educational settings and institutions, compiling materials and tools for students and artists interested in engaging with the field. The tourist guide of the game world doubles as a photography manual for the in-game photography age, featuring tutorials ranging from game screenshotting to computer programming for creative modding. Through the practical exercises, the project invites to rethink the game object as a space for creative, subversive and critical endeavours, which can be played differently, documented, reclaimed or modified through an artistic approach.

Finally, the project draws inspiration from the works of artists who have explored the `metaplay' of photographing game worlds instead of following the game rules and attempt to reach the goal of winning. The Photographer's Guide to Los Santos is indebted to all the artists it features, but was particularly inspired by Gareth Damian Martin's live streamed workshop \href{https://www.twitch.tv/videos/591840067}{\emph{Photography Tour of No Man's Sky}} (realized for \href{https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/now-play-this-2020}{Now Play This Festival 2020}), Total Refusal \& Ismaël Joffroy Chandoutis's 2021 in-game lecture performance and guided tour \href{https://vimeo.com/506064357}{\emph{Everyday Daylight}} (realized for the \href{https://ccsparis.com/en/events/total-refusal-digital-disarmament-movement-a-la-gaite-lyrique/}{CCS Paris}), and Alan Butler's epic 2020 live endurance performance \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Q2G6tOQ_Q}{\emph{Witness to a Changing West}} (realized for \href{https://screenwalks.com/}{Screen Walks}) and his `Content Replication Assignments'.

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Grand Theft Auto V Studies}

Los Santos is the Grand Theft Auto V's fictional, parodic version of real-life Los Angeles. Just like Los Angeles is the global centre of film and commercial media production, Los Santos is the epicentre of in-game photography and machinima creation. While it may seem reductive to only focus on a single game to address the larger phenomenon of in-game photography, GTA V is the biggest source of creative outputs to date, with its extended open world and one of the largest community of active modders.

Launched in 2013, the game contains a world map of more than 80 square kilometers of total area, which includes the urban area of the city of Los Santos and the rural area of Blaine County. This incredibly vast environment features a large desert region, dense forest, several mountains, beachside towns, on top of the large metropolis of Los Santos. The game simulates the everyday life of hundreds of individual NPCs (while it allegedly counts a population of over 4 million) as well as counting 28 animal species, and \href{https://grandtheftdata.com/landmarks/\#0,0,2,satellite}{more than 800 buildings in GTA V are based on real-life landmarks}.

The size of the photorealistic simulation is only matched by the complexity of the game engine and its code, which - thanks to the effort of GTA V's modding community - allows players to use the game world as a powerful tool to create new scenes, take controls of its algorithmic entities, modify cameras and reshaping the game into a movie set or a photo studio.

\section*{Grand Theft Auto V Tourism}\label{grand-theft-auto-v-tourism}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Grand Theft Auto V Tourism}

The project can be seen as something between a playful travel guide of Los Santos and one of the star maps offered to tourist in Hollywood, pointing to the homes of movie actors and hollywood celebrities. This guide allows players to explore the game environment following some of the most interesting artworks that have been created with(in) it. It's divided in thematic chapters that follow different artistic practices, taking place in different locations of the game environment, followed by different tutorials and exercises connected with the works and the space analyzed.

The themes explore different approaches and practices connected to established artistic and photographic currents, with a general introduction text that gives an overview of the ideas, contexts and issues connected to the specific topic. A selection of artworks for each themes is presented by a curatorial statement, introducing the work and its artistic relevance. The work is accompanied by information on the in-game location in which it was produced, inviting the readers to reach the destination in Grand Theft Auto V through maps and indications.

The game environment thus becomes the space for possible `art tours', getting insights into the artworks made in GTA V. This form of game tourism allows the player to see the behind the scenes, and experience the making of the works in its place of origin. While the complex algorithms of GTA V produce unexpected interactions and scenes, Los Santos is also stuck in the same time forever. Gas stations, shops, palm trees remain in the same state and location forever, allowing the tourist to witness the exact scene that was first encountered by the artists.

This project is also an attempt to introduce a video game as a space for artistic intervention, and an invitation to use its mechanics, its code and its environment as a creative tool itself. The game can be played, documented and captured through a form of artistic play, that differs from normative gameplay and does not focus on advancing and winning but rather engages with the game object critically. Furthermore, the game software can also be manipulated, modified and used as an apparatus to create new images and interactions. The goal of this guide is to combine a curatorial approach that leads the viewer to discover the artworks made in GTA V with a hands on approach that teaches the player the tools for possible artistic interventions in this space.

Games are often seen as producing specific cultures and shaping identities through forms of play that follow the intentions of the developer. Here we understand games as objects to be reclaimed and tools to be deconstructed and rebuilt, both conceptually and literally. Consequently, players are not just passive actors that push buttons in the sequence that they are taught by the machine and its softwares, but open up the black box of the game and become critical thinkers and makers that actively play with the game, or even against it.

The Photographer's Guide to Los Santos can be employed as a resource to accompany workshops for students and artists approaching computer games and interested in learning how to engage with it. Each thematic chapter features a tutorial section that introduces different techniques and strategies to capture images within Grand Theft Auto V, connected to the examples and locations of each section. The chapters are thought to be experienced in order, as the tutorials at times rely on knowledge that is built on top of previous lessons. Each tutorial is accompanied by content replication assignments, in which the readers is invited to use the skills learnt from each chapter to recreate a work presented in that section. Tutorials are intended for anyone who might be playing GTA V for the first time in their life and do not assume any previous experience, although some basic idea of programming is helpful when dealing with scripting and modding the game.

\chapter{Architectural Photography}\label{architectural-photography}}

\begin{quote}
``{[}\ldots{]} a virtual urban life, like playing on the keyboard of the city as if it were a land of screen. I saw it as the end of architecture \ldots{} by pushing the concept to its limit and primarily by using the photograph as a point of departure. This is reflected in the idea that the great majority of images are no longer the expression of a subject, or the reality of an object, but almost exclusively the technical fulfilment of all its intrinsic possibilities. It's the photographic medium that does all the work. People think they're photographing a scene, but they're only technical operators of the device's infinite virtuality. The virtual is the device that wants nothing more than to function, that demands to function.''
-- Jean Baudrillard - \emph{The Singular Objects of Architecture and Philosophy}, 2000
\end{quote}

Architectural photography was born with the invention of heliographs, daguerreotypes and large format cameras in the first half of the 19th century. Due to the long exposure times, buildings were the ideal subjects for the early scientific experiments of Joseph Nicéphore Niépce, Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre and William Talbot.

\emph{View from the Window at Le Gras} by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce, 1826-27.

\emph{Paris' Boulevard du Temple} by Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre, 1839.

While the relationship between architecture and photography has been part of the medium from its birth for technical reasons, this form of image making has evolved to visually explore the connection with material spaces and forms, as well as the relation between human perception and architectural bodies. The photographic image is not simply a document of a structure, but ``is, in fact, \emph{part} of its architecture''.\footnote{Lorenzo Rocha, \emph{Photography and Modern Architecture} ,``Concrete - Photography and Architecture'', Scheidegger \& Spiess, 2013} Curator Urs Stahel wrote that ``pictures {[}\ldots{]} offer a discourse that is unlike the physical experience of architecture. They transform volume into surface; distil matter into forms and signs. Photography shapes architecture, enlarging and reducing it, heightening and shortening it, accentuating it, yet largely leaving it to its own devices.''\footnote{Urs Stahel, Foreword to ``Concrete - Photography and Architecture'', Scheidegger \& Spiess, 2013}

The first architectural photographer is considered to be Joseph-Philibert Girault de Prangey, who started to take daguerreotypes of iconic buildings like the Parthenon in Athens and Notre-Dame in Paris from 1841. Architectural photography evolved in two distinct approaches, namely Elevation and Perspective. The Elevation Approach focuses on representing a structure as a two-dimensional image, obtaining a viewpoint that is parallel to the building and aimed at showing as many details as possible. The Perspective Approach aims at depicting the structure within the space, focusing on the third dimension and often taken at an angle or from a vantage point from a corner.

\emph{Facade and North Colonnade of the Parthenon on the Acropolis, Athens} by Joseph-Philibert Girault Prangey, 1842.

Modern architecture started to become an increasingly popular subject within photography as the urban landscapes began to be reshaped. Around 1900, French photographer Eugène Atget started focusing on the disappearing architecture of ``Old Paris''. He captured the alleys and buildings of pre-revolutionary Paris, which were going to be demolished as part of a huge modernization project.
Many of Atget's photographs were taken at dawn, which - combined with the urban solitude and emptiness he portrayed, created a special sense of space and ambience. Many photographers were greatly influenced by his images, including American photographer Berenice Abbott who bought most of Atget's negatives and prints before moving back to New York from Paris.

\emph{Coin rue de Seine}, by Eugène Atget, 1924.

Back in New York, Abbott was confronted with a similar modernization process, with the old New York which was fast disappearing. ``At almost any point on Manhattan Island, -- she noticed -- the sweep of one's vision can take in the dramatic contrasts of the old and the new and the bold foreshadowing of the future. This dynamic quality should be caught and recorded immediately in a documentary interpretation of New York City. The city is in the making and unless this transition is crystalized now in permanent form, it will be forever lost {[}\ldots{]}. The camera alone can catch the swift surfaces of the cities today and speaks a language intelligible to all.''\footnote{Abbott, Berenice, ``Changing New York'' (project proposal, New-York Historical Society, 1932); excerpted in O'Neal, Hank. Berenice Abbott: American Photographer. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1982): 16--17.}

\emph{Chanin Building, New York} by Berenice Abbott, about 1935.

The modernist project in architecture meant embracing a more minimalist approach and rejecting ornament. A rational use of material was combined with an analytical and functional approach. Similarly, modernist photography rejected formal images and the painterly qualities of the pictorialist tradition in favour of a sharp focus, crisp lines and repetition. It celebrated the apparatus as a mechanical tool, and called for a ``straight photography''\footnote{Sadakichi Hartmann, ``A Plea for Straight Photography,'' American Amateur Photographer 16 (Mar.~1904), pp.~101--09; reprinted in Beaumont Newhall, ed.~Photography: Essays and Images (Museum of Modern Art, New York 1980), p.~186.}. The city played a major role in this relationship between urban spaces and their images, with radical architecture and modernist photography sharing an ideological connection. Architects and photographers started working as closely connected pairs in the second half of the XX century. Armando Salas Portugal for Luis Barragán, Bill Engdahl for Mies van der Rohe, Julius Shulman for Richard Neutra are some examples of this tightly connected relationship between the architecture and the image that shapes the space of the time.\footnote{For more information about these three case studies see Lorenzo Rocha, \emph{Photography and Modern Architecture} ,``Concrete - Photography and Architecture'', Scheidegger \& Spiess, 2013.}

The tradition of architectural photography deeply informs in-game photography practices. Games often attempt to include realistic simulations of existing architecture and allow players to navigate their world through the game camera in a way that is directly linked to the camera operations of the analogue photographer who wants to document the city. Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto series has produced game versions of New York (Liberty City), Los Angeles (Los Santos) and Miami (Vice City). Ubisoft's Watch Dogs franchise modelled its worlds around Chicago, San Francisco and London. Actual photographs of architecture and urban spaces lie at the core of how buildings and streets are modelled and simulated in these spaces: the Watchdogs team ``made repeated visits to take photos of different neighbourhoods'' and Rockstar ``distilled 250,000 photographs and countless hours of video into Los Santos, their version of Los Angeles and its hinterland.''\footnote{Hoal, Phil. ``From Watch Dogs to GTA V, why `video games are going to reshape our cities'\,''. The Guardian, 10 June 214. \url{https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/jun/10/watch-dogs-gtav-video-games-reshape-cities-sim-city-will-wright}}
While the games provide reduced approximations of their original counterparts, most of their landmarks are reproduced in great detail and accuracy. These digital copies and playable spaces can also be considered archival doubles for heritage architecture that might get damaged or disappear. When the cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris suffered a structural fire beneath the roof in 2019, it left the iconic Gothic architecture with its spire collapsed, its upper walls severely damaged and most of its roof destroyed. Caroline Miousse, a level artist on the game Assassin's Creed Unity, took around two years modelling the cathedral inside and out, spending 80 percent of her time on the Notre Dame. Miousse ``spent literally years fussing over the details of the building. She poured over photos to get the architecture just right, and worked with texture artists to make sure that each brick was as it should be.''\footnote{Webster, Andrew. ``Building a better Paris in Assassin's Creed Unity'', The Verge, 17 April 2019 (originally published in on 31 October 2014). \url{https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/31/7132587/assassins-creed-unity-paris}} At the time of the fire, many players and fans of the game recalled the 3D model of the cathedral and speculated if the video game could provide help for the reconstruction plans. Ubisoft offered to provide the reconstruction effort with over 5,000 hours' worth of research on the structure, created relying on ``pictures --- photos, videos --- of modern day Notre-Dame.''\footnote{Gilbert, Ben. ``As France rebuilds Notre-Dame Cathedral, the French studio behind `Assassin's Creed' is offering up its `over 5,000 hours' of research on the 800-year-old monument'', 18 April, 2019. \url{https://www.businessinsider.com/notre-dame-fire-assassins-creed-maxime-durand-ubisoft-interview-2019-4?r=US\&IR=T}}

Yet the game is not just a simulation of the physical space and realism is more of an added visual effect, which is still subordinate to gameplay. The architecture in the game is still part of an environment to be played, and not just seen. In the case of Assassin's Creed Unity, this is especially true, as the game mechanics focus on the character's ability to climb over the roofs and buildings of the city. Gameplay priorities intervene on the game architecture, setting realism aside in favour of features that allow the player to better interact with the space. ``We added things like cables and incense across the second level of Notre Dame so players would be able to move around easier when they're above the ground,'' Miousse explained on Ubisoft blog UbiBlog.\footnote{\url{https://blog.siggraph.org/2019/05/how-ubisoft-re-created-notre-dame-for-assassins-creed-unity.html/}} Windows that swing open on the upper levels of the cathedral have also been added, along with gilt panels on the balustrades of the tribune and along the nave, which guide the movements of the player. Bruce Shelley writes that realism contributes to a greater effect but is not essential in gameplay: ``Realism and historical information are resources or props we use to add interest, story, and character to the problems we are posing for the player. That is not to say that realism and historic fact have no importance, they are just not the highest priority.''\footnote{Shelley, Bruce. ``Guidelines for Developing Successful Games'', Gamasutra, August 15, 2001. quoted in Galloway, Alexander R. \emph{Gaming -- Essays on Algorithmic Culture}, University of Minnesota Press, 2006} Speaking to The Verge, art director Mohamed Gambouz noted that the pointy rooftops of Paris in the game had to be smoothed out so as not to interfere with the player's parkour flow. That was just ``one of many changes made to make ACU's Paris not only work better for a game, but also match the vision of Paris that players have in their mind. Gambouz calls it the ``postcard'' effect. `When people talk about Paris they have postcards in their mind,' he says, `even if this postcard isn't accurate or truthful to the setting.'" \footnote{\url{https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/31/7132587/assassins-creed-unity-paris}} There are also technical restrictions that get in the way of realism in game architecture. For example, the tympana above the main doors of Notre Dame's cathedral are full of intricate sculptures, which are not rendered as 3D objects in the game. Instead, the game designers created 2D textures that give the appearance of being sculpted , through ``an optimization technique that looks great and doesn't compromise immersion --- unless you get really close and swing the camera around to break the illusion.''\footnote{\url{https://www.polygon.com/features/22790314/assassins-creed-unity-notre-dame-restoration-accuracy}} Finally, the game architecture might also be affected by copyright laws that protect the original building. ``Notre-Dame is {[}\ldots{]} owned by the French state, not by the Catholic Church, and it's a designated historic monument, to boot, one that's continually being restored. Much of the cathedral is under a patchwork of copyright restrictions.''\footnote{ibid.} That meant that all of the sculptures, the paintings, the rose windows of the church could not be authentic to real life and had to be adapted by the designers to circumvent French copyright laws. Miousse spoke of Notre-Dame's organ: ``It's just so huge and beautiful\ldots{} and copyrighted. We couldn't reproduce it exactly, but we could still try to nail the feeling you get when you see it.'' \footnote{\url{https://blog.siggraph.org/2019/05/how-ubisoft-re-created-notre-dame-for-assassins-creed-unity.html/}}

Similarly, Grand Theft Auto V's Los Santos is a parodic approximation of 2011 Los Angeles, which ``is selectively shrunk for the experience of the gamer. Los Santos represents Los Angeles through fragmentation, simplification and social stereotypes.''\footnote{Teo, Mark D. ``The Urban Architecture of Los Angeles and Grand Theft Auto'', 2015, p.5. \url{https://www.academia.edu/18173221/The_Urban_Architecture_of_Los_Angeles_and_Grand_Theft_Auto}} Countless online videos and articles celebrate Los Santos' realism, with a whole genre of ``GTA 5 vs Real Life'' posts comparing game screenshots with photographs of Los Angeles and its landmarks. The graphical qualities of photorealism of Grand Theft Auto V and the painstaking digital doubling of buildings and structures leave no doubt in each of these posts that Los Santos represents Los Angeles. Its toponymy doubles down on the copy: the Griffith Observatory appears as Galileo Observatory, The Bixby Bridge in Big Sur becomes the Big Creek Bridge, Pershing Square is Legion Square and the iconic Hollywood sign is transformed into the same signage that reads Vinewood instead. Mark D Teo notes that ``the Los Santos conceptualisation of modern Los Angeles is omnipresent and mocking; it is an extension of its former city.''\footnote{ibid. p.50} Grand Theft Auto V is certainly not the first mediated representation of the city of Los Angeles, which has appeared so often in film and television to create in its visitors a sense of uncanny familiarity. D. J. Waldie writes that ``we are all citizens of Los Angeles because we have seen so many movies''\footnote{Waldie, Donald J. ``Beautiful and Terrible: Los Angeles and the Image of Suburbia'', in \emph{Seeing Los Angeles: A Different Look at a Different City}. Los Angeles: Otis Books. 2007} and critic Keith Stewart has suggested that the movie Drive is essentially ``a non-interactive version of Grand Theft Auto.''\footnote{\emph{How Video Games Changed the World}. Directed by Al Camborn, Marcus Daborn, Graham Proud \& Dan Tucker (film). London: Channel 4. 2013. 1hr8mins} Will Jennings argues that Los Santos is to be interpreted as a Situationist fragment collage of Los Angelese, ``akin to Guy Debord's Naked City (McDonough, 2002, p.241), using ideas of the dérive and utilising simulated landmarks not only as mediators between simulated space and the real L.A. but also as navigational devices as outlined in Kevin Lynch's 1960 Image of the City (Tea, 2005).''\footnote{Jennings, Will. ``Learning from Los Santos: Computer games \& their effect on our reading of space'', 2018. \url{https://willjennings.info/Essay-Learning-from-Los-Santos-Computer-games-their-effect-on-our}}

Game architecture is therefore not simply a copy of its physical counterpart and it's not only gameplay, technical limitations and copyright that affect virtual buildings and spaces. Furthermore, the digital technologies at the core of computer graphics and games have completely transformed architecture and photography, as well as the relation between the two. The image in its digital and networked form has come to shape the experience of architecture, to the point of even affecting its creation. Designer Alexandra Lange, talking to the podcast 99\% Invisible, says that especially hotel and restaurant interiors are being affected by Instagram. These spaces are being increasingly designed to lure visitors with their Instagrammabilty. Lange recalls: ``You know, one architect told me that it's really important to have an Instagrammable bathroom.''\footnote{\url{https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/instant-gramification/}} There is a temporal reversal between the architectural photography of the XIX and XX century that documented the experience of the space and contemporary spaces that are built by the image that they will create and distributed online. The image, in other words, comes first. Similarly, architectural renderings of newly planned neighbourhoods create an image of the future and idealised architecture. They are spaces that do not yet physically exist and where the architectural photograph not only precedes them but create them. Before they are built, these spaces are constructed through CGI and software that are enmeshed in both the architectural process as well as the imaging systems. Joel McKim argues that architectural renders belong to the category of ``projective images'', as they ``attempt to bring an as yet non-existent reality into being.''\footnote{McKim, Joel. ``Into the universe of rendered architectural images'', Unthinking Photography, 2019. \url{https://unthinking.photography/articles/into-the-universe-of-rendered-architectural-images}} Such images are becoming ubiquitous and ever more powerful, employed in visualisations of urban speculations and simulation technologies. For McKim these projective images are very much connected to Flusser's idea of the technical image: ``while traditional images depict or represent the outside world, technical images envision or inform it. Technical images, in other words, are not mirrors but projectors. And what they project outwards, in very circular fashion are our very own models, concepts and texts -- what Flusser calls `programs'. Technical images, we might say, are not images or representations of the world, they are visions of the world remade to correspond to our own texts, concepts or programs. Architectural renders are, in many ways, quintessential examples of the technical images Flusser had in mind.''\footnote{ibid.} For Tobias Revell, these architectural images ``overwhelm us into an unquestioned sense that this is the future'', through ``their aesthetic richness -- usually highly saturated, dramatic and glossy -- as well as their physical size {[}\ldots{]}. Once again, they piggyback the camera's perceived objectivity but this time into a kind of hyper-real fantasy so convincing that any disbelief is suspended.''\footnote{Revell, Tobias. ``Rendering the Desert of The Real'', Unthinking Photography, 2019. \url{https://unthinking.photography/articles/rendering-the-desert-of-the-real}} Similarly, game design has been influenced by the history of architecture while at the same time game environments have affected architects, ``blurring the boundaries of what belongs to the physical or the virtual world, with principles from both sides transferring either way.''\footnote{Foulston, Marie. ``Introduction'', \emph{Videogame Atlas: Mapping Interactive Worlds}. Luke Caspar Pearson and Sandra Youkhana. Thames \& Hudson. 2022. p.7}

Game space, however, sits between the copy of physical structures and architectural renderings: it is ``a space neither separate from real space nor simply a continuation of it.''\footnote{Cohen, Julie E. ``Cyberspace As/And Space''. \emph{Georgetown Law Faculty Publications and Other Works. 807}. 2007. scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/facpub/807} Game worlds are somehow stuck between simulating physical spaces in a way that is as realistic as possible, while shaping new visions of cities and ``projecting'' an own image of a world. They are made of (and from) photographs, and they generate new images through computational processes and realistic graphics. Gareth Damian Martin notes that ``we are outnumbered by virtual worlds, overwhelmed by virtual architecture. Videogames and digital art have furnished us with a hundred thousand matterless forms--landscapes where no rock or earth has ever been present, cities founded on depthless skins of image and texture, expanses that will never see the light of a true sun. And yet, somehow there is material here, a new kind of matter. Some of it is borrowed---photographs, texture references, photogrammetry. Other parts are inherent properties of digital worlds--- their obsession with surface, the logic of their light, their base particles; pixels, voxels, polygons.''\footnote{Martin, Gareth Damian. ``Represented , Contested, Inverted''. in \emph{Heterotopias 001}. 2017} On top of that, game spaces are also made to be navigated and experienced. The player who explores the built space inside computer games might turn into a photographer. They stop playing to screenshot virtual architecture, to study the game space in relation to the player.

In-game photographers might also investigate virtual architecture from the perspective of its materiality -- its textures and 3D models -- exploring how its structures are ``built''. In his series \emph{The Edge of The World} and \emph{Flying and Floating}, Robert Overweg examines the impossible buildings and the incongruous textures that make the architectures of games like Half Life 2 and Left 4 Dead 2. The artist writes: ``I try not to follow the roads I am supposed to take, but try to seek out my own path within and outside the given boundaries of the game. I find joy in making use of a glitch/error which gives me the possibility to have a different look at the virtual world. Flying around and running through walls which I am not supposed to do gives me a sense of freedom and the ability to move in ways I can't in the physical world. I want to look behind the curtain of the virtual facade and show it to the world.''\footnote{\url{https://www.shotbyrobert.com/glitches}} Architectural glitch photography is visually reminiscent of Gordon Matta-Clark's 1970s ``anarchitecture'' works. These were photographs and films documenting the artist sawing and carving sections of buildings, revealing the infrastructure and hidden materials of architectural structures.

From the series \emph{Flying and Floating} by Robert Overweg.

Alternatively, photographers use the game object as a tool itself, a device to create structures and architectural images. In a course on digital and networked photography held at F+F School for Art and Media Design Zurich in 2019 (which among other experiences was an inspiration to The Photographer's Guide to Los Santos), Kaja Fuchs worked with her younger sister to create buildings in the game Minecraft based on the iconic work of German photographer Hilla and Bernd Becher. For forty years, the german duo photographed disappearing industrial structures like water towers, coal bunkers, gas tanks and factories. Their images were always taken in black and white and the photographers approached every building in an almost scientific way, bringing multiple structures together in grids. The Fuchs sisters acted in a similar connection to the modernist architect and photographer pairs of the second half of the XX century, reconstructing the water towers in the 3D game and controlling the camera and the visual effects to reproduce the strict photographic rules originally employed by the Bechers. The game space allowed the players to act as both architect and photographer.

A reinterpretation of Hilla and Bernd Becher's \emph{Water Towers} in Minecraft by Kaja Fuchs.

Architecture and photography have been interacting with each other for almost two centuries, affecting each other and taking different roles in many processes of building spaces and imag(in)ing structures. The architectural photograph was born as a representation of the past and from the distance. Throughout the XX century architects and photographers would shape the present by shaping spaces and creating images following the modernist ideology. In its computational and networked form, the image begins to copy physical structures and analogue architectural photography but soon proceeds to shape the creation of space itself. Through its computational simulation, photorealistic graphics and networked circulation, it imagines and projects onto the world. It precedes the built space in the physical world. This virtual architectural image is finally able to be navigated, documented, shaped and played once it becomes part of the game world. Players turned photographers and artists are entangled in this complex journey where images and structures constantly move closer and further apart, where new and old materials merge and structures reject or submit to the laws of physics. In-game photographers document the game architecture but also investigate it, actively explore it and even shape it.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Playing as a Photographer}

Playing as a photographer means ignoring, circumventing and sometimes resist what the game wants us to do and follow our photographic project instead. For starters, we are going to skip the compulsory game introduction, avoid the missions and neglect the narrative plot of the game.
We are going to install a file which allows us to travel to Los Santos with no restriction of any kind, so that we can focus on photographic activities.

To do this we use a completed \href{https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/100-save-game}{game save file}. Download the file and extract its content, then copy both files \texttt{SGTAXXXXX} and \texttt{SGTAXXXXX.bak} in \texttt{Documents/GTA\ V/Profiles/YYYYYYYY/}. Once the files are there, you will be able to load the game state by running GTA V and navigating on the pause menu to \texttt{GAME} \textgreater{} \texttt{Load\ Game} and select the 100\% game file.

With the game save file loaded the player is free from the constraint of the main game missions and locked map areas, but the game will still at times resist the photographic project in different ways. The player can be attacked and killed by mountain lions, or beaten up and sent to the hospital by non playable characters. They can drown, fall to their death and get run over by cars.

//Photographs of a TV screen taken with a digital camera often exhibit moiré patterns. Since both the TV screen and the digital camera use a scanning technique to produce or to capture pictures with horizontal scan lines, the conflicting sets of lines cause the moiré patterns.

Mascha Negri, from \emph{Luftige Enge}, F+F, March 2023.

In \emph{Luftige Enge} Mascha Negri focuses on the industrial areas of Los Santos. Wandering through the buildings in the game, the photographer looked for angles and perspectives that are reminiscent of the work of Germaine Krull as well as Bernd and Hilla Becher. Upon closer inspection, the images show the pixels of the screen, the polygons that make the 3D architecture and the textures of virtual pipes and chimneys. Negri worked with the smartphone camera to photograph the game screen, highlighting the properties of the simulation, while simulataneously following the trajectory of black and white architectural images from the analogue photography tradition. Negri employed digital editing through the smartphone photo app, using high-contrast black and white post-processing to underline the geomatric shapes of the building. The title \emph{Luftige Enge}, literally ``airy narrow'', follows the contrast between the airy appearance of the smoke coming from the pipes and the massive size and dense positioning of the buildings. Finally, the contrast between analogue tradition and digital images, and between air and mass, can be extended to the relation the between post-industrial society and economy of the game industry and the vanishing heavy industry in the west simulated in the game buildings.

``In our work titled „bevhills01afy`` we portray a GTA 5 NPC (non- playable-character). In a first step, we selected an NPC and lovingly renamed them from the developers description „bevhills01afy`` to Simona Lange. The installation resembles her room, personal objects and souvenirs. Its centerpiece is a tablet showing Simonas Instagram.
We merged real objects, In-Game Photographs and artificially generated images. These different media types repeatedly reference each other, bending their individual truth. We point to the blurring of lines between digital and analogue, intelligent and non-intelligent, sentient and unaware, game and real.
Furthermore, we want to highlight the biases and clichés in artificial worlds. Who sets the norms and rules of our worlds? What stereotypes do they contain? What influence do they have on us?''

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Director Mode}

Director Mode allows players to interact with GTA V as a movie set where one can customize the character appearance, weather conditions, vehicle and pedestrian density, and much more.
It was first introduced in the PC version of the game with the Rockstar Editor, and later added to the console title in 2015.

There are 3 ways to access Director Mode:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  On the game pause menu go to \texttt{Rockstar\ Editor} tab (last tab on the right) and select \texttt{Director\ Mode}
\item
  press \texttt{M} key on PC to bring up the \texttt{Interaction\ Menu} and select \texttt{Director\ Mode}
\item
  Press the \texttt{UP\ Arrow\ Key} to take out the in-game smartphone and dial \texttt{1999578253} to activate \texttt{Director\ Mode}.
\end{enumerate}

Note: Director Mode is unavailable when player is in a vehicle, wanted, or active in a mission.

Once activated, the game will open up the main Director Mode scene showing a casting trailer with a menu from which the player can choose from a number of options. Here the player can change the appearnce of their character by selecting a different model.

The player can also set the scene, manipulating the conditions of the game world as if it were a movie set: time of day, weather conditions, populations and vehicle density can all be controlled from the Director Mode menu.

Here is the full list of options available in the Director Mode casting trailer menu:

Once the player has selected their actor and scene setup, they can click on \texttt{Enter\ Director\ Mode} to launch the actress into the game worlld. Note: first person view is only available if the three protagonists characters are chosen.

In Director Mode players can quick travel to a pre-defined location across the game world. Create a waypoint on the \texttt{MAP} from the main menu by selecting a destination on the map and press \texttt{ENTER}. Leave the menu and back in Director Mode press the \texttt{M} key to bring up the Director Mode main menu, and under \texttt{Location} press the \texttt{LEFT\ ARROW\ KEY} to select \texttt{Waypoint}, and press \texttt{ENTER}.

\hypertarget{capturing-gameplay}{%
\subsection*{Capturing Gameplay}\label{capturing-gameplay}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Capturing Gameplay}

There are two ways of to capture gameplay: \texttt{Manual\ Recording} and \texttt{Action\ Replay}.

MANUAL RECORDING
Hold \texttt{ALT\ +\ F1} for \texttt{Manual\ Recording}. Gameplay will be recorded in the background until \texttt{LEFT\ ALT\ +\ F1} is pressed to save the recording or \texttt{LEFT\ ALT\ +\ F3} to cancel the recording.

ACTION REPLAY
This option records gameplay footage after the fact. Press \texttt{F2} to buffer recorded data in the background, but note it will not record anything until you press \texttt{ALT\ +\ F1} to save action replay.

Recorded clips will be between 30 and 90s seconds in length, depending on how busy your action is. You will be notified if you are running out of space on your hard drive and you can define the amount of hard drive space you use for the Rockstar Editor by going to the game main menu in \texttt{SETTINGS} \textgreater{} \texttt{ROCKSTAR\ EDITOR}.

\hypertarget{rockstar-editor}{%
\subsection*{Rockstar Editor}\label{rockstar-editor}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Rockstar Editor}

On the game pause menu go to \texttt{Rockstar\ Editor} tab (last tab on the right) and choose \texttt{Create\ New\ Project}. Then select \texttt{Add\ Clip} to select the footage you want to use.

Recordings will be placed in a timeline: you can scroll through each clip using \texttt{LEFT\ CTRL\ +\ X} or \texttt{Mouse\ Click} and \texttt{Drag} them.
Delete a clip using \texttt{DEL}, duplicate a clip with \texttt{LEFT\ CTRL\ +\ C}, or use the \texttt{Mouse\ Wheel} to scroll through the timeline.

\texttt{Double\ Click} on a clip or press \texttt{ENTER} to begin editing it.

You can change camera angles, effects, speed etc using these. You can scrub through the clip footage using the \texttt{LEFT\ Arrow\ Key} and \texttt{RIGHT\ Arrow\ Key} or the \texttt{Mouse\ Wheel}.

The Camera function allows players to position and control the game camera more freely, with less restrictions than the camera options in game play. There is an exception for gameplay footage captured in first-person perspective: here you cannot change camera angle. If there are any other camera restrictions, you'll see a notification on screen. Aside from that, three different camera settings are available in ROckstar Editor:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \texttt{Game\ Camera}~\\
  This is the default third-person camera view filmed from behind the main character.
\item
  \texttt{Pre-set\ Camera\ angles}
  These are pres-set camera angles that lock the view at the front, behind, sides or above the main character. You can zoom in an out from these.
\item
  \texttt{Free\ Camera}
  The Free Camera can be placed within a defined area but freely around your main character.
\end{enumerate}

Press \texttt{F5} to save your project and camera position.

Take a screenshot or export a Snapmatic picture by pressing the \texttt{TAB} key. This will save your picture in the game gallery and can only be exported out of the game by uploading the image to Rockstar Social Club.

Use the Game Bar to record a video or export your video using the \texttt{Export} option on the Project Main Menu. Here you can set frame rate and bit rate. The video will appear in the Video Gallery inside the Rockstar Editor main menu. From there you can view it and upload it to either YouTube or the Rockstar Social Club.

``Nella società della sovrastimolazione, c'è un confine tra schermo e realtà?
La carne si oppone al disincarnato tecnologico.
Il gioco diviene un sogno ad occhi aperti, a tratti più lucido del reale, da cui siamo attratti e intrappolati. Come la deformazione della carne in videodrome allo stesso modo la mappa di GTAV ci intrappola in un mondo dai confini limitati che ci permette (o ci fa credere) di poter fare e di poter essere qualsiasi cosa, o quasi.

The main events of Script Hook V Dot Net are onTick, onKeyUp and onKeyDown. Script Hook V Dot Net will invoke your functions whenever an event is called.

The code within the onTick brackets is executed every interval milliseconds (which is by default 0), meaning that the event will be executed at every frame, for as long as the game is running.

If your function is written inside onKeyDown (withiin the curly brackets following onKeyUp(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)\{\}), your code will be executed every time a key is pressed. If your function is written inside onKeyUp, your code will be executed every time a key is released.

\hypertarget{change-player-model}{%
\subsection*{Change Player Model}\label{change-player-model}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Change Player Model}

The player character is controlled as \texttt{Game.Player}. \texttt{Game.Player} can perform different functions, including changing the avatar model.

Change the 3D model of your character by using the \texttt{ChangeModel} function.
The function needs a model ID, in order to load the model file of our game character.
You can browse through \href{https://gtahash.ru/skins/}{this list of models} to find the one you want to try (note: not all models seem to load properly).

These models are all PedHashes, basically ID numbers within the PedHash group. Copy the name of the model below the image and add it to PedHash.
For example if you choose the model Poodle, you'll need to write \texttt{PedHash.Poodle}.

To change the model of your player character into a poodle you can write the following function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Game.}\FunctionTok{Player}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{ChangeModel}\NormalTok{(PedHash.}\FunctionTok{Poodle}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

add it in your .cs file in the onKeyDown event, triggered by the pressing of the `h' key:

Try to select different models and assign them to different keys to change the model of your character. Use keys that are not already implemented in the game controls to avoid clashes with built in operations.

\hypertarget{tasks}{%
\subsection*{Tasks}\label{tasks}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Tasks}

Our character can be controlled by our script, and given actions that override manual control of the player. These actions are called \emph{Tasks} and in order to assign tasks to our characters we have to define our \texttt{Game.Player} as \texttt{Game.Player.Character}. The \texttt{Game.Player.Character} code gets the specific model the player is controlling.

Now we can give tasks to the character by adding the \texttt{Task} function: \texttt{Game.Player.Character.Task}.

Finally we can specify what task to give the character by choosing a task from \href{https://nitanmarcel.github.io/shvdn-docs.github.io/class_g_t_a_1_1_task_invoker.html}{TaskInvoker list} of possible actions.

Jump:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Some of the tasks are temporary and accept a time parameter (in milliseconds). Others are persistent, meaning they will keep being executed until the task is actively stopped. To stop a task you can use the \texttt{ClearAllImmediately();} command:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

We use the \texttt{Random}function to create a randomly generated number between our minimum and maximum parameter (if only one parameter is inserted, the minimum is 0).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Random rnd = }\KeywordTok{new} \FunctionTok{Random}\NormalTok{(); }

Let's create a number to generate a random duration between 1 and 6 seconds, for the \texttt{HandsUp} task.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{NPCs}

NPCs are non playable characters and in GTA V scripting they are called \texttt{Peds}. Peds are an entity like Props or Vehicles and can be created, assigned different model textures, equipped with weapons and controlled through different tasks.

\hypertarget{spawn-a-new-npc}{%
\subsection*{Spawn a new NPC}\label{spawn-a-new-npc}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Spawn a new NPC}

A GTA V Ped can be created by the \texttt{World.CreatePed} function. This takes two parameters: an ID to assign the 3D model and textures, and the location where the Ped is created.

The model IDs are the same we used in the previous tutorial, when we changed our character's appearance to a cat. A list of all available models can be found \href{https://wiki.gtanet.work/index.php/Peds}{here}. \texttt{PedHash.Cat}, \texttt{PedHash.Deer}, \texttt{PedHash.AviSchwartzman}are all possible IDs we can assign to the NPC we want to create.
We can create a new model variable, which we will name `myPedModel' and assign it a model ID:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Model myPedModel = PedHash.}\FunctionTok{AviSchwartzman}\NormalTok{;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The location where the NPC is created through a vector3 data type, which represents a vector in 3D space. This basically means a point that contains X, Y and Z coordinates. We can give absolute coordinates, making the Ped appear at a specific location in the game, but we can also use a location relative to our position in the game. In order not to risk making a Ped appear somewhere completely outside of our view -- on some mountain or in the sea -- let's look at a vector3 that points to a position in front of the player.

We want to establish the player with\texttt{Game.Player.Character}, followed by a function that retireve the player position within the game world. That's called by using \texttt{GetOffsetInWorldCoords}, which takes a vector3. The values of the X, Y and Z of the vector 3 offset the location based on the origin point represented by the player. Therefore, we can move the place where we want the Ped to appear by adding values to the X axis (left or right of player), Y axis (ahead or behind the player), and Z axis (above or below the player).
To make a Ped appear in front of the player we can create a vector3 data type with 0 for X, 5 for Y and 0 for Z: \texttt{new\ Vector3(0,\ 5,\ 0)}. Let's make a vector3 variable, which we will name `myPedSpawnPosition', assign it the values above for X, Y and Z coordinates from the player position.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Vector3 myPedSpawnPosition = Game.}\FunctionTok{Player}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Character}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{GetOffsetInWorldCoords}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{new} \FunctionTok{Vector3}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{));}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now we can use the model and the position variables to spawn the NPC in front of the player. We'll create a Ped named `myPed1' and use the \texttt{World.CreatePed} function with the two variables as parameters:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{var}\NormalTok{ myPed1 = World.}\FunctionTok{CreatePed}\NormalTok{(myPedModel, myPedSpawnPosition); }
\end{Highlighting}

\hypertarget{control-multiple-npcs}{%
\subsection*{Control Multiple NPCs}\label{control-multiple-npcs}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Control Multiple NPCs}

You can create multiple NPCs and give them custom names. Let's create a human NPC and a cat NPC and call them Jim and MannyTheCat respectively:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{var}\NormalTok{ Jim = World.}\FunctionTok{CreatePed}\NormalTok{(PedHash.}\FunctionTok{AviSchwartzman}\NormalTok{, Game.}\FunctionTok{Player}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Character}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{GetOffsetInWorldCoords}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{new} \FunctionTok{Vector3}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{)));}
\DataTypeTok{var}\NormalTok{ MannyTheCat = World.}\FunctionTok{CreatePed}\NormalTok{(PedHash.}\FunctionTok{Cat}\NormalTok{, Game.}\FunctionTok{Player}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Character}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{GetOffsetInWorldCoords}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{new} \FunctionTok{Vector3}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{)));}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Try to kill one of the \texttt{Ped} NPCs you created by using the \texttt{Kill()}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Jim.}\FunctionTok{Kill}\NormalTok{();}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note that when you kill your \texttt{Ped} `Jim', it falls on the floor and it won't actually respond to any call or task you will give it, but it's not removed from the game. To remove a specific \texttt{Ped} you have to use the \texttt{Delete}function, which will remove that instance (and will make the NPC disappear).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Jim.}\FunctionTok{Delete}\NormalTok{();}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To handle groups of NPCs we can use the \texttt{List} class. A \texttt{List} is a collection of objects, and a \texttt{List}of \texttt{Peds} allows us to store our NPCs. We can use an index to retrieve and control specific \texttt{Peds} in the group. You can see the \href{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1?view=net-7.0}{reference} for more detailed information.

Create a \texttt{List} of \texttt{Peds} named myPeds as a global variable in the public class \texttt{public\ class\ moddingTutorial\ :\ Script}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{List<Ped> myPeds = }\KeywordTok{new}\NormalTok{ List<Ped>();}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In the onKeyDown function \texttt{private\ void\ onKeyDown(object\ sender,\ KeyEventArgs\ e)} create 5 new Peds with a \href{https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_for_loop.php}{For Loop}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{for}\NormalTok{ (}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{ i = }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{; i < }\DecValTok{5}\NormalTok{; i++)}
\NormalTok{\{}
    \CommentTok{//spawn a new Ped called newPed}
    \DataTypeTok{var}\NormalTok{ newPed = World.}\FunctionTok{CreatePed}\NormalTok{(PedHash.}\FunctionTok{Clown01SMY}\NormalTok{, Game.}\FunctionTok{Player}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Character}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{GetOffsetInWorldCoords}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{new} \FunctionTok{Vector3}\NormalTok{(i}\FloatTok{-2.5f}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{8}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{)));}
    \CommentTok{//add the new Ped to my list of Peds myPeds}
\NormalTok{    myPeds.}\FunctionTok{Add}\NormalTok{(newPed);}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now all the 5 \texttt{Peds} are part of the myPeds{[}{]} \texttt{List}. You can control each Ped individually by calling their individual number ID in the group. The first spawn \texttt{Ped} is myPed{[}0{]}, the last one is myPeds{[}4{]}.

Tell the 1st spawned NPC to start wandering around:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{myPeds[}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{].}\FunctionTok{Task}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{WanderAround}\NormalTok{();}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Kill the 2nd spawned NPC:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{myPeds[}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{].}\FunctionTok{Kill}\NormalTok{();}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Tell the 3rd NPC to jump:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{myPeds[}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{].}\FunctionTok{Jump}\NormalTok{();}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Tell the 4th NPC to walk toward the camera:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{myPeds[}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{].}\FunctionTok{GoTo}\NormalTok{(GameplayCamera.}\FunctionTok{Position}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Tell the 5th NPC to put their hands up for 3 seconds:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{myPeds[}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{].}\FunctionTok{Task}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{HandsUp}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{3000}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{nearby-npcs}{%

Script Hook V DOt Net provides a function \texttt{GetNearbyPeds}which groups all the \texttt{Peds} within a nearby radius from a character.

Create a new group that adds \texttt{Peds} which are closer than 20 meters from the player (add that as a global variable in \texttt{public\ class\ moddingTutorial\ :\ Script}):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Ped[] NearbyPeds = World.}\FunctionTok{GetNearbyPeds}\NormalTok{(Game.}\FunctionTok{Player}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Character}\NormalTok{, 20f);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Use a \href{https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/asp-dot-net-tutorial/csharp-foreach\#:~:text=The\%20foreach\%20loop\%20in\%20C\%23,readable\%20alternative\%20to\%20for\%20loop.}{Foreach Loop} to get every \texttt{Ped} in the group and give them the task to put their hands up for a second:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{foreach}\NormalTok{ (Ped p }\KeywordTok{in}\NormalTok{ NearbyPeds)}
\NormalTok{\{}
\NormalTok{    p.}\FunctionTok{Task}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{HandsUp}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1000}\NormalTok{);}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\texttt{GetNearbyPeds} does not sort out individual \texttt{Peds}in the group based on distance, so we have to do a bit of manual filtering to get the nearest NPC within the chosen radius from the player character.

Define the global variables in the public class \texttt{public\ class\ moddingTutorial\ :\ Script}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{float}\NormalTok{ lastDistance;}
\NormalTok{Ped nearestPed = }\KeywordTok{null}\NormalTok{;}
\NormalTok{Ped oldNearestPed = }\KeywordTok{null}\NormalTok{;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Get and parse the nearby NPCs in the OnTick function \texttt{private\ void\ onTick(object\ sender,\ EventArgs\ e)}:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{//set radius}
\DataTypeTok{float}\NormalTok{ maxDistance = 25f;}
\CommentTok{//get nearest peds      }
\NormalTok{Ped[] pedsGroup = World.}\FunctionTok{GetNearbyPeds}\NormalTok{(Game.}\FunctionTok{Player}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Character}\NormalTok{, maxDistance);}

    \KeywordTok{if}\NormalTok{ (distance < lastDistance)}
\NormalTok{    \{}
\NormalTok{        nearestPed = ped;}
\NormalTok{        lastDistance = distance;}
\NormalTok{    \}}
\NormalTok{\}}

    \KeywordTok{if}\NormalTok{ (nearestPed != }\KeywordTok{null}\NormalTok{ && oldNearestPed != nearestPed)}

\NormalTok{    \}}
\NormalTok{oldNearestPed = nearestPed;}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{give-tasks-to-npcs}{%
\subsection*{Give Tasks to NPCs}\label{give-tasks-to-npcs}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Give Tasks to NPCs}

A Ped can be given a task using the \texttt{Task} function, just like we did in the previous tutorial for the player character.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{myPed1.}\FunctionTok{Task}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{WanderAround}\NormalTok{();}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Some tasks involve interacting with other characters (Peds or Game.Player.Character) or take different parameters like positions (vector3), duration (in milliseconds), and other data types.
We can give our NPC the task to fight against the player by using the \texttt{FightAgainst} function, which requires a Ped parameter -- which in the case of the player is expressed as \texttt{Game.Player.Character}.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{myPed1.}\FunctionTok{Task}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{FightAgainst}\NormalTok{(Game.}\FunctionTok{Player}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Character}\NormalTok{); }\CommentTok{//give npc task to fight against player}
\end{Highlighting}

Try to replace the task to ``fight against'' with ``flee from (player)'' , ``hands up'', ``jump''\ldots{} or some of the other available tasks.

You can spawn a group of NPCs and give them individual tasks. You can also make them interact with each other (or with the player character). Here we spawn 3 NPCs and tell the to fight with each other.

\subsection*{Scenarios}\label{scenarios}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Scenarios}

Screnarios are short looping animations that can be triggered with the \texttt{Task} of type \texttt{StartScenario}. Unlike other animation types (see next chapter below), scenarios include props with the moevement of the character. Also, certain scenarios only work with specific model, so we won't be able to make a deer drink coffe or use a binocular (we'll make a deer pole dancing later don't worry).

Scenarios can be invoked by using the task \texttt{StartScenario(string\ \ name,\ Vector3\ \ \ position,\ float\ \ \ \ \ heading)}. the \texttt{StartScenario} task function requires 3 paramenters: the name of the scenario we want to play, the position in which our Ped will be playing the scenario (through a Vector3 data type containing the XYZ coordinates), and the rotation degree (between 1 and 360° - note: this seems to work only when applied to the player character and not on Ped NPCs).

Try to play the scenario animation \texttt{WORLD\_HUMAN\_TOURIST\_MAP} on our game character:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Game.}\FunctionTok{Player}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Character}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Task}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{StartScenario}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"WORLD_HUMAN_TOURIST_MAP"}\NormalTok{, Game.}\FunctionTok{Player}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Character}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Position}\NormalTok{, 1f);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

To stop the scenario animation you can use \texttt{Game.Player.Character.Task.ClearAllImmediately();} like with every other task.

We can give scenarios to multiple Peds just like we gave different tasks to NPCs in the section above. We can add a \texttt{List} to store multiple scenarios, just like we made a \texttt{List} to store multiple NPCs. Then we can control individual NPCs and trigger specific scenarios by going through the list items.

For example the following line will control the first NPC Ped we created, and made them play the third scenario in the list (note that items added to list start from 0, so the first one is actually number 0).

In the code below we press \texttt{G} to spawn 5 Peds of model Clown in front of the player character, and we add 5 scenarios to our list. Then press \texttt{H} to make each Ped play one of the scenarios. Use \texttt{J}to stop the task and \texttt{K} to delete the Peds and clear the list.

You need to request the animation dictionary before start using it in your script: \texttt{REQUEST\_ANIM\_DICT}.
After that, wait for the animation to load (or you could check if it's loaded with the boolean \texttt{HAS\_ANIM\_DICT\_LOADED}), before playing the animation.

Once you have requested your animation dictionary and it is loaded, you can play and stop the specific animation using \texttt{TASK\_PLAY\_ANIM} and \texttt{STOP\_ANIM\_TASK}.

\hypertarget{playing-sounds}{%
\subsection*{Playing Sounds}\label{playing-sounds}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Playing Sounds}

We can control sounds from the game as well as playing external sound files. Here's an overview of a few different functions to can play speech recordings and audio from the GTA V audio bank, and a method to play a custom .wav file saved onside the ``scripts'' folder.

PLAY AMBIENT SPEECHES

The native function \texttt{\_PLAY\_AMBIENT\_SPEECH1} and \texttt{\_PLAY\_AMBIENT\_SPEECH2} both do the same thing: they make the character say a few lines, with the voice of the character model, and with their relative mouth and body animations. The speeches are, as the name suggest, ambient lines of dialogue that main characters and NPCs say throughout the game in different situations.

\texttt{\_PLAY\_AMBIENT\_SPEECH1} will take as parameters the Ped that is going to speak, a string of the speech name, the speech parameter string and an integer that is set to 1.

Try to use the native function to make the player character say something from the \texttt{"GENERIC\_BYE"} speech bank:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Function.}\FunctionTok{Call}\NormalTok{(Hash._PLAY_AMBIENT_SPEECH1, Game.}\FunctionTok{Player}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Character}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"GENERIC_BYE"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"SPEECH_PARAMS_FORCE"}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You will see that every time you use that function the character will say one possible variation (``bye'', ``later on'', ``bye now'' if you use the character of Franklin) contained in the generic bye speech. If you change your character thespeech will change accordingly, although not every character has speech associated with them. For speech parameters, the easiest is to stick with ``SPEECH\_PARAMS\_FORCE''.

Here you can find a list of all available speech names.

PLAY AMBIENT SPEECHES WITH A DIFFERENT VOICE

We can also play an ambient speech with a different voice from the one of the character we are using. The function \texttt{\_PLAY\_AMBIENT\_SPEECH\_WITH\_VOICE} takes as parameter the Ped that will speak, the speech ID, the speech voice model and speech parameters.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{ Function.}\FunctionTok{Call}\NormalTok{(Hash._PLAY_AMBIENT_SPEECH_WITH_VOICE, Game.}\FunctionTok{Player}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Character}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"GENERIC_BYE"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"A_F_M_BEVHILLS_01_WHITE_FULL_01"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"SPEECH_PARAMS_FORCE"}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Function.}\FunctionTok{Call}\NormalTok{(Hash._PLAY_AMBIENT_SPEECH_WITH_VOICE, Game.}\FunctionTok{Player}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Character}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"GENERIC_BYE"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"A_F_M_BEACH_01_WHITE_FULL_01"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"SPEECH_PARAMS_FORCE"}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Not every speech model has all the recorded ambient speech, so we must try and see what works and what doesn't.

PLAY PAIN SOUNDS

Apart from ambient speech, we can also play ``pain'' sounds. The native function \texttt{PLAY\_PAIN} contains different kind of screams that can be played. Depending on the model, the screams will be more likely an integer of value 6, 7 or 8. Try to mess with the code find out what kind of screams can be played. Not for the faint of heart:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Function.}\FunctionTok{Call}\NormalTok{(Hash.}\FunctionTok{PLAY_PAIN}\NormalTok{, Game.}\FunctionTok{Player}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Character}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{6}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can disable and enable these sounds for each character using the native \texttt{DISABLE\_PED\_PAIN\_AUDIO} and setting it to true or false:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Function.}\FunctionTok{Call}\NormalTok{(Hash.}\FunctionTok{DISABLE_PED_PAIN_AUDIO}\NormalTok{,Game.}\FunctionTok{Player}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Character}\NormalTok{ , }\KeywordTok{true}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

PLAY SOUND FILES FROM GTA V SOUND BANK

We can also play a sound file from an audio bank of GTA V sound files. To do that we first load the audio bank, then we use the native function \texttt{PLAY\_SOUND\_FROM\_ENTITY}, specify the audio file name, the character and the audio reference.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{//load the audio bank}
\KeywordTok{while}\NormalTok{ (!Function.}\FunctionTok{Call}\NormalTok{<}\DataTypeTok{bool}\NormalTok{>(Hash.}\FunctionTok{REQUEST_SCRIPT_AUDIO_BANK}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"Michael_2_Acid_Bath"}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{-1}\NormalTok{))\{ }\FunctionTok{Wait}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{);\}            }
\CommentTok{//play the audio file}
\NormalTok{Function.}\FunctionTok{Call}\NormalTok{(Hash.}\FunctionTok{PLAY_SOUND_FROM_ENTITY}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{-1}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"ACID_BATH_FALL"}\NormalTok{, Game.}\FunctionTok{Player}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Character}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"MICHAEL_2_SOUNDS"}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

PLAY EXTERNAL SOUND FILES

Finally we can play an external sound file by using the \texttt{SoundPlayer} object. \texttt{SoundPlayer} is simple but limited and only accepts .wav files. To use it, first add \texttt{using\ System.Media} at the very top of your code, to import the reference.

Create a new player as a global variable and load the file

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{SoundPlayer player = }\KeywordTok{new} \FunctionTok{SoundPlayer}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"./scripts/Eran_N.wav"}\NormalTok{);}
\NormalTok{player.}\FunctionTok{Load}\NormalTok{();}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

And on key press you can use play and stop to control playback

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{//play}
\NormalTok{player.}\FunctionTok{Play}\NormalTok{();}

\CommentTok{//stop}
\NormalTok{player.}\FunctionTok{Stop}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{teleporting}{%
\subsection*{Teleporting}\label{teleporting}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Teleporting}

We can change the location of the player character or of any Ped or Vehicle entity by using the native function \texttt{SET\_ENTITY\_COORDS}. This function needs an entity and X, Y and Z coordinate to teleport to.
We need to know the exact coordinates of the locations we want to teleport to, but thankfully the modding community forums provide lists with all available coordinates we can teleport to. Let's take the XYZ coordinates of the top of Mount Chiliad (the highest point in the game) to teleport our player character to.

\begin{verbatim}
LOCATION: Top of the Mt Chilad
COORDINATES: X:450.718 Y:5566.614 Z:806.183
\end{verbatim}

To create a teleport function we will use a native function. Script Hook V Dot Net is a wrapper for the C++ ScriptHook, calling the functions in Scripthook to do things in the game. However, there are some functions that are not in Script Hook V Dot Net and in order to use these, we have to use the native calling from Script Hook.

\href{https://nitanmarcel.github.io/shvdn-docs.github.io/namespace_g_t_a_1_1_native.html\#a84977424e1cb7b6f1c2902770bf9ad2d}{Native functions} are called with \texttt{Function.Call} followed by their corresponding hash name and parameters. They use this structure:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Function.}\FunctionTok{Call}\NormalTok{(Hash.}\FunctionTok{HASH_NAME}\NormalTok{, input_params);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The native function for teleporting expects the hash \texttt{SET\_ENTITY\_COORDS}, the \texttt{ped} entity to teleport, and the X, Y and Z coordinates to teleport the character to. \texttt{Function.Call(Hash.SET\_ENTITY\_COORDS,\ Ped\ ped,\ X,\ Y,\ Z,\ 0,\ 0,\ 1);}

The function to teleport the player character to the top of Moutn Chiliad is:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{//Teleport to the top of Mount Chiliad}
\NormalTok{Function.}\FunctionTok{Call}\NormalTok{(Hash.}\FunctionTok{SET_ENTITY_COORDS}\NormalTok{, Game.}\FunctionTok{Player}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Character}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{450.718f}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{5566.614f}\NormalTok{, }\FloatTok{806.183f}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{);}

``A surrealistic photo experiment in the world of Grand Theft Auto V. For this work I modified the game via modding and made use of the Rockstar Editor, a tool that allows players to edit, create and share in-game content via social media. What I did was to experiment with how far the Rockstar Editor was able to push the creation of images and videos with the available processing power of the computer. I tried to use as many different tools that the game offers and as few external tools as possible.
Inspired by the 1953 painting Golconda by René Magritte, which depicts a scene of''raining men``. The artwork shows white-collar workers ascending near the Maze Bank Tower, the tallest building in the game. The four images and a video show a dissimilar atmosphere in the well-known world of GTA V, where it is very difficult to tell if they were created in the game. Although the work is open to interpretation, many have associated it with Richard Drew's photograph The Falling Man.''

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Using Props to Light a Scene}

In addition to NPCs, we can also spawn and control objects. There are more than 15000 objects in the GTA V database that can be accessed and search through \href{https://gta-objects.xyz/objects}{this index}. From yachts to paintings, from flower vases to rocks, they vary in scale and properties and constitute all the objects that are present in the game world.

Objects are referred as \texttt{Prop} variables in the code, and similarly to \texttt{Ped} and \texttt{Vehicle} they are a \texttt{GTA\ Entity} data type.
To create a new prop we use the \texttt{World.CreateProp} function. This needs the following parameters: a string with the prop file name, the relative of absolute 3D coordinates of where the prop should be created, the 3D rotation value (optional, if not specified the prop will have default rotation values), a true/false boolean to set the object as dynamic or static, a true/false boolean for snapping the object on the ground or spawning it at an arbitrary position.

\texttt{GTA.World.CreateProp(model\ :\ Model\ ,\ position:\ Vector3,\ rotation:\ Vector3,\ dynamic\ :\ bool,\ onGround\ :\ bool)}

Let's create a \texttt{Prop} variable called MyProp and let's make an alarm siren appearing 3 meters in front of the player, with default rotation, dynamic and snapping to its original position:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{Prop MyProp = World.}\FunctionTok{CreateProp}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"xm_prop_x17_sub_alarm_lamp"}\NormalTok{, Game.}\FunctionTok{Player}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{Character}\NormalTok{.}\FunctionTok{GetOffsetInWorldCoords}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{new} \FunctionTok{Vector3}\NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{, }\DecValTok{-3}\NormalTok{)), }\KeywordTok{true}\NormalTok{, }\KeywordTok{false}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

By default the siren is placed on top of a ceiling, so it will appear above the player.

To delete a prop we can call the \texttt{Prop} variable we created and use the \texttt{Delete()} function:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{MyProp.}\FunctionTok{Delete}\NormalTok{();}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can also remove Collisions by using the \texttt{IsCollisionEnabled}boolean to false:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{MyProp.}\FunctionTok{IsCollisionEnabled}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{false}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

There are several hundreds different light objects within the game's database. We can use these object to manipulate the light for our shots, just like a photographer would do in the studio.

Try spawning ``prop\_spot\_clamp\_02'' to get harsh spot lights

We can control the time and the light for our shots to the second in GTA V. We can specify the exact time of the day with the native function \texttt{SET\_CLOCK\_TIME}, followed by hour, minute and second. Note that the sun sets at 5:30 a.m. and goes down at 8 p.m.

\subsection*{Scripting Cinematic Fade Out / In}\label{scripting-cinematic-fade-out-in}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Scripting Cinematic Fade Out / In}

Script Hook has native functions to create a fead to/from black. The function hash are \texttt{DO\_SCREEN\_FADE\_OUT} and \texttt{DO\_SCREEN\_FADE\_IN} and they are followed by the number of milliseconds to go from full black to showing the scene and viceversa.

Let's create a fade to black over 3 seconds when we press the letter key `O':

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{if}\NormalTok{ (e.}\FunctionTok{KeyCode}\NormalTok{ == Keys.}\FunctionTok{O}\NormalTok{)}

\end{Shaded}

And a fade over 3 seconds when we press the letter key `I':

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{if}\NormalTok{ (e.}\FunctionTok{KeyCode}\NormalTok{ == Keys.}\FunctionTok{I}\NormalTok{)}

\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We could also create an automated check in our onTick loop, which keeps seeing if the screen has been faded to black. We can use the native function \texttt{IS\_SCREEN\_FADED\_OUT} which is a boolean data type. This means it will return either true or false. If it returns true, it means the screen has been faded out.

Let's add an ``if'' statement in our onTick loop to chek if the screen has been faded to black, and if so we teleport somewhere else and we call a fade in over 3 second:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{if}\NormalTok{ (Function.}\FunctionTok{Call}\NormalTok{<}\DataTypeTok{bool}\NormalTok{>(Hash.}\FunctionTok{IS_SCREEN_FADED_OUT}\NormalTok{))}

\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Now if you try to hit the `O' key, the screen will fade out, and then it will automatically fade in again.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Natural Vision Evolved Mod}

Natural Vision Evolved (NVE) is a graphic mod develped by \href{https://www.razedmods.com/}{Jamal Rashid, aka Razed}. This mod enhances GTA V's lighting, weather effects, ambient colours, world textures, building models, pushing the photo-realism and cinematic looks. While the mod contains settings for different hardware settings, it's recommended to have a relatively powerful PC with a good graphic card. \href{https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/requirements/gta-5-naturalvision-remastered/16594}{Here} you can find minimum and recommended requirements for Natural Vision Evolved mod.

Installation and setup:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Go to \href{https://www.razedmods.com/gta-v}{razedmods.com/gta-v} and download Natural Vision Evolved (6.2 Gb).
\item
  Go to \href{https://openiv.com/}{openiv.com/} and download Open IV, Open `ovisetup' and install Open IV on your computer.
\item
  Select GTA V Windows. Choose Grand Theft Auto V folder \texttt{C:\textbackslash{}Program\ Files\ (x86)\textbackslash{}Steam\textbackslash{}steamapps\textbackslash{}common\textbackslash{}Grand\ Theft\ Auto\ V}
\item
  Once Open IV is open, go to your file window select the \texttt{Tools} menu on top of the window, and select \texttt{ASI\ Manager}. In \texttt{ASI\ Manager} install all options: ASI Loader, OpenIV.ASI and openCamera.
\item
  Select \texttt{Tools} again and click \texttt{Options}. Click on the \texttt{"mods"\ folder} tab and select \texttt{Allow\ edit\ mode\ only\ for\ archive\ inside\ "mods"\ folder}. Click \texttt{Close}.
\item
  Select \texttt{Edit\ mode} at the top right of the window. Select \texttt{OK} on the pop up window.
\item
  Now you can add your mod to the mods folder.
\item
  Open the NVE mod folder, extract and select NaturalVision Installer PART ONE and drag it to Open IV. Install the file and select ``mod folder'' when asked to choose. After that is complete, extract and select NaturalVision Installer PART TWO and drag it to Open IV. Install the file and select ``mod folder'' when asked to choose. The Installers have to be executed in order: first do PART ONE, and then do PART TWO.
\item
  Go back to your downloads and inside the NVE folder you can choose some optional addons. Install/Uninstall them with Open IV as above. Always choose to select ``mod'' folder and select install.
\item
  Open GTA V, press \texttt{ESC} to bring up the menu and go to \texttt{SETTINGS}. Adjust the graphics quality, making sure \texttt{Shader\ Quality}, \texttt{Particle\ Quality} and \texttt{Post\ FX}are set to \texttt{\textless{}Very\ High\textgreater{}}. Restart the game to make change in effect. More details about installation are provided in the README file inside the NVE zip folder.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{ReShade}

ReShade is a generic post-processing injector for games and video software developed by crosire.

Installation and setup:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Go to \href{http://static.reshade.me/}{reshade.me} and download the latest version
\item
  Open ReShade Setup and select Browse and navigate to your Grand Theft Auto V folder and select GTA 5.exe. Leave Direct X 10/11/12 checked and click Next. When asked to select presets to install click on Skip.
\item
  Select SweetFX by CeeJay.dk and all the effect packages you want to install (OtisFX by Otis\_Inf and CobraFX by SirCobra are particularly interesting for simulation of analogue photography, including depth of field) and complete installation. You can also select and install all filters, so you can play around with them all.
\item
  Run GTA V and press the \texttt{Home\ key} to bring up the menu. The first time you bring up Reshade, it will offer to give a short tutorial on how to choose and create presets. You can use the ReShade Default preset to turn on and off all the different filters. Each filter can be adjusted by modifying its parameters at the bottom of the panel.
\item
  Create a new preset by duplicating the ReShade Default preset and giving it a custom name. Mess around with its setting to see how it affects the visuals of the game. Thanks to different effects and presets, the aesthetics of the game world can be configured to obtain looks that are completely different from the original graphics created by the deleopers and designers of the game.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Controlling the Game Camera}

We can detach the camera from the player's character and move freely around the game world. We instantiate a new \texttt{Camera} variable called \texttt{FreeCam}. We define it as the new world camera with the same position and rotation of the gameplay camera:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{FreeCam = World.}\FunctionTok{CreateCamera}\NormalTok{(GameplayCamera.}\FunctionTok{Position}\NormalTok{, GameplayCamera.}\FunctionTok{Rotation}\NormalTok{, GameplayCamera.}\FunctionTok{FieldOfView}\NormalTok{);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We then define our new camera as the main camera with \texttt{World.RenderingCamera\ =\ FreeCam}. In order to control the camera we basically its vectors in 3D coordinates and multiply with a number over a certain direction to move towards a specific destination.
A free camera -- unlike the main character view -- also allows us to move through the game architecture and terrain, revealing the construction of the game world. Press \texttt{O} to toggle the free camera On and off.

\subsection*{Recording and Replaying Camera Movements}\label{recording-and-replaying-camera-movements}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Recording and Replaying Camera Movements}

We can record the movement of the camera by storing its posiiton and movement every frame in a list of Vector3 variables. Then we can simply access the list and assign the position of the camera at each frame. This is useful to create reusable camera movements, like tracking shots and cinematic camera movements. Once we have achieved the desired camera movement, we can spawn objects in the scene and adjust color grading before saving the screengrab.
In this example, turn on the free camera by pressing \texttt{O} and then start and stop the recording of the camera movement by pressing \texttt{I}. To toggle the replay camera press \texttt{K}.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Attaching a Camera to an Entity}

We can also attach a camera to a car, a prop or an NPC. The Camera object in \texttt{GTA} has \texttt{AttachTo} function we can call, followed by two paramenters: the entity we want to attach the camera to and the position relative to the entity.
Attaching a camera to an NPC can provide interesting views and perspectives. Here we create a cat NPC by pressing \texttt{G} and attach a camera to it. We can switch the camera view by pressing \texttt{SHIFT\ +\ K} and let the cat follow the player by pressing \texttt{H}.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Creating and Switching between Multiple Cameras}

The easiest way to create multiple cameras is position invisible Ped NPCs in specific locations, make them invisible with the native function \texttt{SET\_ENTITY\_VISIBLE} and attach a camera to them. We can switch between the different cameras with \texttt{SHIFT\ +\ K}. These can be used as different cameras to surveil and look at scenes in different locations within the game world.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Switching Character through Satellite Camera View}

We can use the native function \texttt{START\_PLAYER\_SWITCH} to enable the satellite view animation from the game, and get transported to a different location where an NPC or player avatar is spawned. Press \texttt{G} to move across divverent NPCs at different location through the satellite camera transition.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Menyoo Mod Trainer}

Game trainers are a kind of game modification that changes its behavior using addresses and values. Trainers are used to gain unfair advantage in games and cheating, but they are also used by players to ``train'' themselves under different game conditions. In GTA V a trainer mod is very useful for creative practices, as it allows players to modify many aspects of the game that extend the possibilities offered by the official Scene Director and Rockstar Editor. They do not require scripting and offer control of the game world through a more intuitive graphic interface.

Menyoo is one of many available mod trainers for GTA V. It's the most popular trainer because of its incredibly wide range of features, controlling NPCs, vehicles, props and scenes, and allowing players to generate custom interiors and objects from GTA V's database of entities, dynamic scenarios, and entire sets and scenes for machinima and photographic projects.

\hypertarget{installation-and-setup}{%
\subsubsection*{Installation and setup}\label{installation-and-setup}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Installation and setup}

Menyoo requires Scripthook V and Scripthook V Dot Net which we already installed in order to enable our scripts (check chapter 5 if for some reasons you do not have them installed).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In order to install the Menyoo Single Player Trainer go to \href{https://github.com/MAFINS/MenyooSP/releases}{github.com/MAFINS/MenyooSP/releases} and download the \texttt{MenyooSP.zip} file in the Assets section of the page. Open its content and select the \texttt{menyooStuff} folder and \texttt{Menyoo.asi} file. Copy and paste these in your GTA V directory.
\item
  Run GTA V and press \texttt{F8} to bring up the Menyoo Trainer menu. From there you can control many of the functions we are learning to script, including character models, animations, and teleporting.
\end{itemize}

//\url{https://forums.gta5-mods.com/topic/64/menyoo-object-spooner-tutorial}

Scripting will always give you more accurate control of what you can achieve, but a trainer mod is very useful in showing what's possible and it's a much more accessible tool for those who are less incline to code. Finally, all of the tools in this guide are not mutually exclusive, but can be combined together: menyoo can be used with custom scripts, ReShade, screenshotting, Scene Director and Rockstar Editor, allowing the player to really have complete control of the game and its world. In the example below we have used code to spawn 5 clown NPCs and to position the game camera, the weather manipulated in Menyoo to create a meteor shower, and we used a shallow depth of field lens and color grading in ReShade.

\subsection*{CodeWalker}\label{codewalker}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{CodeWalker}

CodeWalker is an application created by \href{https://github.com/dexyfex/CodeWalker}{dexyfex} that renders an interactive 3D Map for GTAV. Through CodeWalker we are able to modify the architecture and objects inside the map, replacing textures and images with custom content.

\hypertarget{installation-and-setup-1}{%
\subsubsection*{Installation and setup}\label{installation-and-setup-1}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Installation and setup}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Go to the \href{https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/codewalker-gtav-interactive-3d-map}{CodeWalker GTA V 3D Map + Editor page} and click download. Extract the content of the .zip folder and open the CodeWalker application. Once the GTAV installation folder has been found, the world view will load by default. Use \texttt{WASD\ Keys} to move, and \texttt{Mouse\ Drag} to rotate the camera view. \texttt{Mouse\ Wheel} zooms in/out and controls the movement speed.
\item
  Click on the arrow on the top left of the screen, then select \texttt{Enable\ Mods} and \texttt{Enable\ DLC}.
\item
  On top of the panel click on \texttt{Options\ \textgreater{}\ Lighting}. Deselect \texttt{Deferred\ shading} and in \texttt{Time\ of\ Day} set the time to 12:00. Then click on \texttt{Save\ Settings}.
\end{itemize}

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Creating Custom Maps}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Next we are going to hit the \texttt{T} key and select the \texttt{Select\ objects} tool from the tool bar.
\item
  Click on the \texttt{Move} tool, which allows to select things by right clicking on them. Hovering on the object will highlight the bounding box of the model, right clicking it will enable the movement of the object. Try dragging an object in 3D space, clicking and dragging one of the 3D axis arrows.
\item
  Undo the changes by pressing \texttt{Undo} from the tool bar or \texttt{Ctrl\ +\ Z} until the object is back in its original position.
\item
  Now press the first tool on the left in the tool bar: \texttt{New}. This will open the Project window.
\item
  Select an object with the \texttt{Select\ objects} tool and you will see that the object information is updated in the Project window, including the object's position, rotation and file name (archetype). Choose an object and click \texttt{Add\ to\ Project}. This will add the object to our ymap.
\end{itemize}

Note: do not delete assets from the game map. Simply select an object that can be added to the project.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  With the \texttt{Select\ objects} tool and \texttt{Move} tool selected, hold \texttt{SHIFT} and drag the object to multiply the object. In this example we have multiplied a chair a few times, moved them and rotated them.
\item
  Once you are happy with your changes, go to \texttt{File\ \textgreater{}\ New\ \textgreater{}\ Ymap\ File} in the Project window. This creates a new ymap called \texttt{map1.ymap}.
\item
  We can also add objects that are not in the immediate vicinity of the location we want to add them to. Select map1.ymap in the Project window, and from the window menu press \texttt{Ymap\ \textgreater{}\ New\ Entity}. This will create a default egg. In the Project window go to Archetype and replace the file name with the one of the object you want. You can refer to \href{https://gta-objects.xyz/}{this database} to find the file name reference of each object easily (or use the \texttt{Select\ objects} tools and copy the Archetype info from your desired object).
\item
  Once you are done click on the \texttt{Save} icon and save your file in a folder titled YMAP.
\item
  In the Project window now go to \texttt{Tools} and click on \texttt{Manifest\ Generator...}. Click on \texttt{Save\ \_manifest.yml} and save them as \_manifest1.yml //memo: actually this is only needed for custom YMap on FiveM, so we could skip it here
\item
  Go to Open IV \textgreater{} mods \textgreater{} update \textgreater{} x64 \textgreater{} dlcpacks, click Edit Mode and create a folder named custom\_maps. Inside the folder copy the file dlc.rpf that you can find \href{https://github.com/marcodemutiis/the-photographers-guide-to-los-santos/blob/main/assets/custom_maps/dlc.rpf}{here}.
\item
  Now go to Open IV \textgreater{} mods \textgreater{} update \textgreater{} update.rpf \textgreater{} common \textgreater{} data. Find dlclist.xml, richt click on it and choose edit. Scroll to the end of the file and add \texttt{\textless{}Item\textgreater{}dlcpacks:/custom\_maps/\textless{}/Item\textgreater{}\ above\ \textless{}/Paths\textgreater{}} and save.
\item
  Finally go to Open IV \textgreater{} mods \textgreater{} update \textgreater{} x64 \textgreater{} dlcpacks \textgreater{} custom\_maps \textgreater{} dlc.rpf \textgreater{} x64 \textgreater{} levels \textgreater{} gta5 \textgreater{} \_citye \textgreater{} maps \textgreater{} Custom\_maps.rpf. Make sure Edit Mode is on and place your .ymap file here.
\item
  Now open GTA V and go to the location where you made the changes and see if they are there.
\item
  Depending on the kind of objects you have place, and the flags you set, you will be able to interact with them, and the game will also recognize them and span some NPCs on them.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{editing-and-replacing-textures}{%
\subsubsection*{Editing and replacing textures}\label{editing-and-replacing-textures}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{Editing and replacing textures}

Another way in which we can intervene in the game world and modify it, is to replace existing images with custom ones. Every object in the game is made of a 3D model and one or more texture files attached to it. Textures are are 2D image files that are applied to 3D surfaces. In this example we'll swap the existing image of a billboard banner with a custom image.

For editing textures in game, we need two additional pieces of software installed before we go ahead: Adobe \href{https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html}{Photoshop} and \href{https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-texture-tools-exporter}{NVIDIA Texture Tools Exporter Plugin for Adobe Photoshop)}. Note that versions prior to Photoshop CC (5.0 - CS6) require the \href{https://developer.nvidia.com/gameworksdownload\#?dn=texture-tools-for-adobe-photoshop-8-55}{legacy version of the plugin}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Open CodeWalker and find a texture you want to replace. Use the \texttt{Select\ objects} to move objects around until you find where the texture you want to change is. We are going to replace a billboard banner with a custom image. More specifically we'll replace the banner containing the ``Fame or Shame'' illustration with the posters of the exhibition \href{https://www.howtowinat.photography/}{How to Win at Photography}. In this case we can see that the billboard structure is not part of the image, and that the banner is actually part of the ground model.
\item
  In the CodeWalker menu on the right go to \texttt{Selection} and check the filename of the object that contains our image. In our case that is ``sp1\_04\_ground''. This is the name of the .ydr file that contains the map model.
\item
  Open Open IV and copy ``sp1\_04\_ground'' into Open IV's search bar on the top of the window. Then click on \texttt{Search\ in\ all} under the ``No items match your search'' text. Select and double click on ``sp1\_04\_ground.ydr'' and click on \texttt{Copy\ to\ "mods"\ folder}. This will create a duplicate of the files so that we can make changes to them without corrupting the original files.
\item
  Double click on ``sp1\_04\_ground.ydr'' to bring up OpenIV Model Viewer and inspect the 3D model. Click on \texttt{{[}+{]}\ Add\ texture} from the menu on the bottom right and select the different .ytd texture files associated with the model. If you select ``spi\_04.ytd'' or ``spi\_04+hi.ytd'' you'll load the texture of the billboard banner. These .ytd files are textures that are applied to the 3D model, and the two files are the ones that are loaded by the game when the camera is closer and further from the object respectively.
\item
  Close the Model Viewer and back in Open IV look for the ``spi\_04.ytd'' texture file. Double click on it to bring up Open IV Texture Editor. Inside the .ydt file you will see all the .dds files contained in it. We have 2 files in ``spi\_04.ytd''. We can preview them by selecting them and we can find the banner image in ``sp1\_04\_rss\_hc\_bbrd\_01''. We select that, click \texttt{Export\ selected} and save the file somewhere on our computer.
\item
  We open the file we saved in Photoshop. Modify the image as you want and then flatten all layers (ctrl+E) in Photoshop. Then choose \texttt{Save\ as\ a\ copy} and select .DDS type file and replace the file. The NVIDIA DDS Plugin interface will pop up. Here it's important to set the file type tp the same kind as the original .dds file. In this example the file is a DXT1 type, which is equivalent to the ``BC1a 4bpp with 1 bit alpha'' option. Select that and hit \texttt{Save}
\item
  Close Photoshop and back in Open IV go back to ``spi\_04.ytd'' and bring up Open IV Texture Editor. Select ``sp1\_04\_rss\_hc\_bbrd\_01'' again and now click \texttt{Replace}. Select the modified file form your computer and click \texttt{Save}.
\item
  Do the same for ``spi\_04+hi.ytd''. Try to make the image as similar as possible so that when the game switches between the files (according to the player distance) the change is seamless.
\item
  When all the textures are modified with our custom image, relaunch CodeWalker and verify that the image has changed.
\item
  Finally launch GTA 5 and you should be able to find your texture appearing inside the game.

The most reliable way to send keyboard and mouse input is the SendInput function in user32.dll.

The SendInput function takes three parameters: the number of inputs, an array of INPUT for the inputs we want to send, and the size of our INPUT struct. The INPUT struct includes an integer that indicates the type of input and a union for the inputs that will be passed.

Keys are mapped to Direct Input Keyboard hex codes. You can find a list of all hex codes for each key \href{http://www.flint.jp/misc/?q=dik\&lang=en}{here} or below.
